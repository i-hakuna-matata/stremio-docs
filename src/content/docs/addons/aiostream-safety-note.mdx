**Purpose of this page:** This page provides educational information about streaming add-ons that may provide access to unauthorized content. It does NOT provide installation or configuration instructions. Read carefully to understand the risks.
</Callout>

## What is AIOStream?

**AIOStream** and similar add-ons are third-party Stremio extensions that aggregate and provide access to video streams from various online sources. These add-ons typically:

- Scrape torrent indexing sites
- Access file hosting services
- Connect to debrid services
- Aggregate streams from multiple sources

**Primary purpose:** These add-ons are designed to find and provide streams of movies and TV shows, often including copyrighted content that users may not have legal authorization to access.

---

## Why This Page Exists

You may have encountered AIOStream or similar add-ons through:
- Online forums or communities
- YouTube tutorials
- Recommendations from friends
- "How to watch free movies" guides

**This page exists to:**
1. Explain what these add-ons actually do
2. Clarify the legal and safety risks
3. Provide information on how to remove them if installed
4. Suggest legal alternatives

<Callout type="legal">
**This guide's policy:** We do NOT provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, or using add-ons whose primary purpose is to access copyrighted content without authorization. This page is for education and harm reduction only.
</Callout>

## Legal Risks

### Copyright Infringement

Using AIOStream or similar add-ons to access copyrighted content (movies, TV shows, sports) without authorization is **illegal in most jurisdictions**, including:

- United States (DMCA violations)
- European Union (Copyright Directive)
- United Kingdom (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act)
- Canada (Copyright Act)
- Australia (Copyright Act)
- Most other countries

### Potential Consequences

**Individual users have faced:**
- ❌ **ISP warnings** (copyright infringement notices)
- ❌ **Service suspension** (ISP cutting off internet)
- ❌ **Fines** (€300-€1,000+ in some EU countries)
- ❌ **Legal action** (rare but increasing for repeat offenders)

**Reality check:**
- Most enforcement targets distributors, not individual streamers
- However, laws are tightening and enforcement is increasing
- ISP monitoring and automated detection are becoming more common

<Callout type="warning">
**Common myth:** "Streaming isn't illegal, only downloading is."  
**Reality:** In most jurisdictions, streaming copyrighted content without authorization is a form of copyright infringement, even if you don't keep a permanent copy.
</Callout>

## Privacy Risks

### What These Add-ons Can See

When you use streaming add-ons like AIOStream:

**The add-on developer can log:**
- Your IP address
- What content you search for
- What you watch and when
- Your device information
- Your viewing patterns

**The stream sources can see:**
- Your IP address (especially with torrent-based streams)
- Your download/upload patterns
- Your ISP information

**You have no control over:**
- Where this data is stored
- Who has access to it
- Whether it's sold to third parties
- How long it's retained

### Tor rent-Specific Privacy Risks

Many of these add-ons use **torrent streams**, which means:

- ✅ Your IP address is **visible to everyone in the torrent swarm**
- ✅ Your ISP can see you're using BitTorrent
- ✅ Copyright holders monitor torrent swarms and log IP addresses
- ✅ This data is often used for enforcement actions

**Even with a VPN:**
- VPNs can leak your real IP (DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks)
- VPN services may log your activity
- Using a VPN doesn't make illegal activity legal

---

## Security Risks

### Malware and Exploits

Streaming add-ons from unofficial sources can:

- Contain **malware** disguised as video players or codecs
- Redirect you to **phishing sites**
- Exploit vulnerabilities to **compromise your device**
- Install **adware or spyware**

### How to Spot Red Flags

🚩 **Requests to install additional software** (codec packs, players)  
🚩 **Excessive ads or pop-ups** (especially for adult content or gambling)  
🚩 **Requests for personal information** or payment details  
🚩 **Requires disabling antivirus** or security features  
🚩 **Promoted on sketchy websites** or through spam

2. Go to **Add-ons** (puzzle icon in sidebar)
3. Click the **Installed** tab

5. Click **"Uninstall"**
6. Confirm the removal

### Step 2: Clear Your Cache

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll to **Advanced** section
3. Click **"Clear Cache"**

<Callout type="tip">
Uninstalling the add-on stops future activity, but it doesn't erase logs the add-on developer may have collected while it was installed.
</Callout>

## If You Received a Copyright Notice

If your ISP sent you a notice about streaming activity:

### Immediate Steps

1. ✅ **Stop the activity immediately**
2. ✅ **Uninstall the offending add-on** (see steps above)

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ **Ignore the notice** (it may escalate)
- ❌ **Respond admitting guilt** (don't incriminate yourself)

- ❌ **Continue the activity** (it makes things worse)

### Consider

- **Consulting a lawyer** in your jurisdiction (if the notice threatens legal action)
- **Contacting your ISP** to understand their policy (warnings vs. suspension vs. legal action)
- **Reviewing your internet usage habits** to prevent future issues

<Callout type="legal">
**This is not legal advice.** If you face legal consequences, consult a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.

**No judgment here**—just questions to consider.
