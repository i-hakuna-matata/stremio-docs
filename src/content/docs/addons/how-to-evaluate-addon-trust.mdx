Evaluating add-on trustworthiness is crucial for maintaining a safe and secure Stremio experience. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for assessing add-on safety.

## Why Trust Evaluation Matters

Add-ons have access to:
- Your search queries and viewing habits
- Device information and network data
- Potentially sensitive account information
- Content streaming and playback

<Callout type="warning">
Malicious add-ons can steal data, inject malware, track your activity, or compromise your device's security. Always evaluate add-ons before installation.
