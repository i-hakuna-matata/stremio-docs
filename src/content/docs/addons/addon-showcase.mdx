## Troubleshooting Add-ons

Common issues reported on Reddit and their solutions.

### "No Streams Found"

**Reddit Solutions**:

> "90% of the time this is fixed by reinstalling the add-on. Just remove it and add it back." - u/it_support_reddit (r/StremioAddons)

<Steps>
1. Check add-on status at status.dinsden.top
2. Verify internet connection
3. Reinstall the add-on
4. Try a different add-on
5. Check if content is region-locked
</Steps>

### "Slow Add-on Loading"

**Reddit Solutions**:

> "If Torrentio takes forever, try Comet. If both are slow, it's your internet or Stremio cache." - u/speed_troubleshooter (r/StremioAddons)

<Steps>
1. Clear Stremio cache (Settings > Advanced > Clear cache)
2. Reduce number of active add-ons
3. Try a faster add-on (Comet vs Torrentio)
4. Check your network speed
5. Restart Stremio
</Steps>

### "Add-on Suddenly Stopped Working"

**Reddit Solutions**:

> "Check Reddit first. If an add-on breaks, someone posts about it within 30 minutes." - u/reddit_first_responder (r/StremioAddons)

<Steps>
1. Check r/StremioAddons for announcements
2. Visit status.dinsden.top
3. Check add-on developer's GitHub/Discord
4. Try reinstalling with updated URL
5. Switch to alternative add-on temporarily
</Steps>

### "Duplicate Streams"

**Reddit Solutions**:

> "If you see the same stream listed 50 times, you probably have multiple add-ons providing the same sources. Remove redundant add-ons." - u/duplicate_detective (r/StremioAddons)

**Fix**: Keep only one primary streaming add-on (Torrentio OR Comet, not both)
