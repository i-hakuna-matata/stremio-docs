**Critical:** This page explains what add-ons are and how they work. Understanding this is essential for safe, legal, and effective use of Stremio. Read carefully.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

- What add-ons are and why they matter
- Types of add-ons (catalogs, streams, metadata, subtitles)
- How add-ons work technically
- Risk levels and how to evaluate trust
- Legal and safety considerations

---

## What is an Add-on?

An **add-on** (also called a plugin or extension) is a small piece of software that extends Stremio's functionality by connecting it to external content sources.

### The Simple Analogy

Think of Stremio as a **smart TV**

, and add-ons as **channel packages**:

- The TV itself doesn't create content—it displays channels
- Each channel package (add-on) brings different content
- You choose which packages to subscribe to

**Key principle:** Stremio is neutral. Add-ons determine what you can watch and whether it's legal.

---

## Why Stremio Uses Add-ons

### The Philosophy

Stremio's developers deliberately chose **not** to include content sources in the app itself. Instead:

- **You control** what sources you connect to
- **You're responsible** for evaluating the legality of each add-on
- **Stremio remains neutral** and legal worldwide

This design puts power (and responsibility) in your hands.

### The Benefits

✅ **Flexibility** — Choose exactly the sources you want  
✅ **Privacy** — Stremio doesn't know what you watch via add-ons  
✅ **Customization** — Build your perfect media center  
✅ **Legality** — You can use Stremio 100% legally by choosing legal add-ons  

### The Trade-offs

⚠️ **Learning curve** — You need to understand what you're installing  
⚠️ **Maintenance** — Add-ons can break and need updating  
⚠️ **Risk** — Bad add-ons can be illegal, unsafe, or malicious  

---

## Types of Add-ons

Add-ons fall into four main categories:

### 1. 📚 Catalog Add-ons

**What they do:** Provide **lists of content** (movies, shows, channels) to browse.

**Examples:**
- Cinemeta (Stremio's default metadata catalog)
- YouTube (catalog of YouTube videos)
- TMDB catalogs

**What they provide:**
- Organized lists ("Popular Movies," "Top TV Shows," etc.)
- Metadata (posters, titles, descriptions)
- **No actual streams** (just information)

**Legal status:** Generally legal—they're just organizing information.

**Safety:** Low risk if from trusted sources.

---

### 2. 🎬 Stream Add-ons

**What they do:** Provide **playable streams** (actual video sources) for content.

**Examples:**
- YouTube (provides streams of YouTube videos)
- Official network add-ons (if they exist)
- **Piracy-focused add-ons** (we don't name them here)

**What they provide:**
- Links to video files (HTTP, HLS, torrents, etc.)
- Quality options (480p, 1080p, 4K, etc.)

**Legal status:** **Varies widely**
- Legal: YouTube, official sources, content you own
- Illegal: Torrents of copyrighted content, scraped pirate sites

**Safety:** **High risk** if used for illegal content (legal consequences, malware, privacy issues)

<Callout type="legal">
**This guide's stance:** We explain how stream add-ons work but do NOT provide installation instructions for add-ons designed to access unauthorized copyrighted content.
</Callout>

---

### 3. 🏷️ Metadata Add-ons

**What they do:** Provide **information about content** (posters, descriptions, cast, ratings, etc.).

**Examples:**
- Cinemeta (default)
- TMDB (The Movie Database)
- Custom metadata add-ons (like AIOMetadata-style add-ons)

**What they provide:**
- Posters and backdrops
- Plot summaries
- Cast and crew info
- Release dates, ratings, genres

**Legal status:** Completely legal (it's just information).

**Safety:** Very low risk if from reputable sources.

---

### 4. 💬 Subtitle Add-ons

**What they do:** Provide **subtitle files** for movies and shows.

**Examples:**
- OpenSubtitles (community-driven subtitle database)
- Subscene
- Language-specific subtitle sources

**What they provide:**
- SRT files (subtitle text)
- Multiple languages
- Synchronized timing

**Legal status:** Generally legal (subtitles are usually fan-made or licensed separately).

**Safety:** Low risk from reputable sources. Avoid sketchy subtitle sites (malware risk).

---

## How Add-ons Work (Technical Overview)

You don't need to understand this to use Stremio, but it helps:

### The Process

1. **You install an add-on** → Stremio saves its URL/configuration
2. **You browse or search** → Stremio asks installed add-ons: "Do you have this content?"
3. **Add-ons respond** → They return catalogs, streams, metadata, or subtitles
4. **Stremio displays results** → You see the combined results from all add-ons
5. **You click "Play"** → Stremio uses the selected stream to play the video

### Where Add-ons Run

Most add-ons are **remote web services**:
- They run on someone else's server
- Stremio communicates with them via the internet
- You don't download the add-on code to your device (just a configuration)

**Implication:** The add-on developer can:
- See your requests (what you search for, what you click)
- Log your IP address
- Stop service at any time
- Change behavior without your knowledge

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy risk:** Installing an add-on means trusting the developer with your activity data. Choose wisely.
</Callout>

## Add-on Risk Levels (Detailed)

Not all add-ons are equally risky. Use this framework to evaluate:

### 🟢 Green: Low Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Provides only metadata or catalogs (no streams)
- Official or widely trusted source
- Open-source (can be audited)
- No payment or personal info required
- Clear privacy policy

**Examples:**
- Cinemeta
- TMDB
- OpenSubtitles

**What can go wrong:** Almost nothing. Worst case: outdated info or service goes offline.

---

### 🟡 Yellow: Medium Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Provides streams from legal sources (YouTube, Twitch, official networks)
- Requires account/API key from a legitimate service
- Reputable but not open-source
- Minor privacy concerns

**Examples:**
- YouTube
- Twitch
- Podcasts

**What can go wrong:** 
- Service changes terms and breaks the add-on
- Minor privacy leaks (what you watch is shared with the service)

---

### 🟠 Orange: Elevated Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Provides streams from gray-area sources
- Debrid services (when used for content you don't own)
- Requires payment to questionable services
- Unclear developer identity

**Examples:**
- Debrid service integrations (when misused)
- Geo-unlocking add-ons

**What can go wrong:**
- Legal gray area (depending on jurisdiction and use)
- Payment to unreliable service
- Moderate privacy and security risks

---

### 🔴 Red: High Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Provides streams of copyrighted content without authorization
- Scrapes torrent sites or pirate file hosts
- No clear developer or privacy policy
- Promoted on sketchy websites
- Requires disabling security features

**Examples:**
- We don't name them, but if it promises "free movies and TV," it's likely here

**What can go wrong:**
- **Legal consequences** (ISP warnings, fines, lawsuits)
- **Privacy violations** (activity logging, data selling)
- **Security threats** (malware, phishing, device compromise)
- **Ethical issues** (harms content creators)

<Callout type="legal">
**Do not install red-level add-ons.** The risks far outweigh any perceived benefits. See [Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/) for alternatives.
</Callout>

## How to Evaluate an Add-on (Checklist)

Before installing ANY add-on, ask yourself:

### ✅ Basic Trust Questions

- [ ] Do I know who developed this add-on?
- [ ] Is it from a reputable source (official Stremio community, known developer)?
- [ ] Can I find reviews or discussions about it from trustworthy people?
- [ ] Is the add-on open-source (or at least transparent about what it does)?

### ✅ Legal Questions

- [ ] Does this add-on provide access to content I have legal rights to access?
- [ ] If it provides copyrighted content, is it licensed or authorized?
- [ ] Am I comfortable defending my use of this add-on in court if needed?

### ✅ Privacy Questions

- [ ] What data will this add-on collect about me?
- [ ] Does it have a privacy policy?
- [ ] Do I trust the developer with my viewing history and IP address?
- [ ] Does it require account credentials (red flag unless it's for a service I already use)?

### ✅ Security Questions

- [ ] Does it require suspicious permissions?
- [ ] Does it ask me to disable security features on my device?
- [ ] Is it promoted on sketchy websites or through spam?
- [ ] Have others reported malware or security issues?

**If you answer "No" or "I don't know" to any of these, reconsider installing the add-on.**

## Common Add-on Misconceptions

### Myth: "If it's in Stremio's add-on catalog, it must be safe"

**Reality:** Stremio allows community add-ons with minimal curation. Presence in the catalog doesn't imply endorsement or safety.

### Myth: "I need lots of add-ons to get good content"

**Reality:** More add-ons = more complexity and risk. Install only what you need and trust.

### Myth: "Add-ons are permanent and reliable"

**Reality:** Add-ons can break, go offline, or change overnight. They're maintained by third parties, not Stremio.

### Myth: "Uninstalling an add-on erases all traces"

**Reality:** The add-on developer may have logged your activity while it was installed. Uninstalling stops future data collection but doesn't erase past logs.

---

## Best Practices for Managing Add-ons

### ✅ DO:

- **Start with one or two trusted add-ons** and add more only as needed
- **Regularly audit your installed add-ons** (monthly)
- **Uninstall add-ons you don't use** (reduces attack surface)
- **Read about an add-on before installing** (Google it, check forums)
- **Prefer open-source add-ons** when possible

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Install every add-on you come across**
- **Trust add-ons just because they're popular** (popularity ≠ legality or safety)
- **Share your Stremio setup with others without explaining the risks**
- **Ignore warnings** from your device or antivirus about an add-on

---

## Legal Add-on Use Cases

Yes, you can use Stremio 100% legally with add-ons! Here's how:

### 1. YouTube and Podcasts

- Install YouTube and podcast add-ons
- Watch freely available content
- Completely legal and safe

### 2. Metadata and Organization

- Install metadata add-ons (Cinemeta, TMDB)
- Use Stremio as a catalog to track what you want to watch
- Watch content on official platforms (link out from Stremio)

### 3. Subtitle Enhancement

- Install OpenSubtitles or similar
- Use with content you legally own or access
- Improves accessibility legally

### 4. Personal Media

- Use add-ons that connect to your own servers (Plex, DLNA, etc.)
- Stream your own legally acquired files

<Callout type="tip">
**You don't have to pirate to use Stremio.** Legal use cases are valid and valuable.
</Callout>
