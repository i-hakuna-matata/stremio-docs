## What is AIOStream?

**AIOStream** (All-In-One Streams) is a powerful Stremio add-on that revolutionizes how you find and stream content. Unlike traditional add-ons that only search one or two sources, AIOStream aggregates streams from **multiple scrapers simultaneously**, providing you with the best available streams from various platforms.

### How AIOStream Works

AIOStream acts as a **stream aggregator and manager** that:

- **Scrapes multiple torrent indexing sites** and direct download sources
- **Combines results** from different scrapers into a unified, ranked list
- **Applies intelligent filtering** based on your preferences (quality, size, source type)
- **Integrates with debrid services** for premium access
- **Provides real-time search** across all configured sources
- **Uses dynamic strategies** to optimize search speed vs. quality

### What is a Scraper?

A **scraper** in the context of AIOStream is a service that searches and extracts streaming/download links from various sources. Think of scrapers as "search engines" that:

- **Index torrent sites** (1337x, ThePirateBay, RARBG, etc.)
- **Search file hosting platforms** (Mega, MediaFire, Google Drive)
- **Aggregate direct streaming links** from various web platforms
- **Return structured data** about available streams (quality, size, seeders, etc.)

Popular scrapers include:
- **Torrentio** - Torrent aggregator with Real-Debrid integration
- **Comet** - Fast torrent scraper
- **MediaFusion** - Direct streaming links
- **Orionoid** - Premium torrent indexer
- **Zilean** - Lightweight torrent scraper

</Callout>

### Step 3: Choosing Your Scrapers

Scrapers are the search engines that find streams. This is where AIOStream gets its power from multiple sources.

#### Recommended Scraper Setup (Start Here):

**Primary Scrapers (Enable These First):**
- **Torrentio** - Best for debrid users, excellent quality selection
- **Comet** - Fast searches, good for quick results

**Advanced Scrapers (For Power Users):**
- **KnightCrawler** - Specialized scraper for specific content types

<Callout type="info">
**How to configure scrapers:**
1. In AIOStream settings, find the "Scrapers" section
2. Check the boxes for the scrapers you want to use
3. Set priorities (1 = highest priority, search this first)
4. Start with 3-4 scrapers to avoid overwhelming your system
</Callout>

### Step 4: Quality Preferences

Tell AIOStream what quality you prefer and what to avoid.

#### Resolution Settings:
Choose your preferred resolutions in order of preference:
1. **2160p (4K)** - Highest quality, largest files
2. **1080p (Full HD)** - Great quality, reasonable file sizes
3. **720p (HD)** - Good quality, faster downloads
4. **480p (SD)** - Acceptable for older content or slow connections

#### Quality Tiers (What Sources to Trust):
AIOStream uses a color-coded system:

**🟢 Green (Best Quality):**
- REMUX, BluRay, WEB-DL, BluRay REMUX
- These are your highest quality sources

**🟡 Yellow (Good Quality):**
- WEBRip, HDRip, BDRip
- Solid quality for most viewing

**🟠 Orange (Acceptable):**
- HDTV, PDTV
- Okay for TV shows, not great for movies

**🔴 Red (Avoid These):**
- CAM, TS, TC, SCR
- Very low quality, avoid if possible

#### File Size Limits:
- **Minimum Size**: Set to avoid tiny files (2GB for movies, 500MB for episodes)
- **Maximum Size**: Set to avoid massive files (50GB for movies, 10GB for episodes)

### Step 5: Search Strategy & Performance

AIOStream can search smartly to balance speed vs. comprehensive results.

#### Dynamic Search Strategy (Recommended):
Instead of searching everything slowly, AIOStream stops when it finds good enough results:

**When to stop searching:**
- Found 5+ high-quality cached streams
- Have at least 3 streams in your preferred resolution
- Found streams from trusted sources (BluRay, REMUX, etc.)
- Search has taken longer than 8 seconds

**Benefits:**
- Faster results for popular content
- Comprehensive results for rare content
- Adapts to what's available

#### Timeout Settings:
- **Search Timeout**: How long to search total (8-12 seconds recommended)
- **Scraper Timeout**: How long to wait per scraper (3-5 seconds)
- **Individual timeouts** prevent slow scrapers from holding up results

### Step 6: Content Filtering

Block unwanted content and focus on what you want to watch.

#### Language Preferences:
- Choose your preferred audio languages
- Block foreign language content if desired
- Set subtitle preferences

#### Block Unwanted Releases:
Use simple text patterns to block content:

**Block low-quality releases:**
```
Block anything containing: CAM, TS, TC, SCR, R5
```

**Block specific file types:**
```
Block files ending with: .avi, .divx, .wmv, .flv
```

**Block specific uploaders/groups:**
```
Block releases from: -GROUPNAME, [UNWANTED]
```

**Block small files:**
```
Block files smaller than: 2GB (for movies), 500MB (for episodes)
```

### Step 7: Stream Display & Organization

Customize how streams appear in your list.

#### Stream Title Format:
Choose what information to show in stream titles:

**Recommended format:**
```
Quality + Resolution + Source + Size + Seeders
```

**Example results:**
- 🟢 1080p BluRay 8.5GB 150S (Great quality, well-seeded)
- 🟡 720p WEBRip 4.2GB 50S (Good quality, decent seeds)
- 🔴 480p CAM 1.8GB 5S (Low quality, avoid)

#### Display Options:
- **Show resolution**: Yes, helps choose quality
- **Show source type**: Yes, helps identify quality tiers
- **Show file size**: Yes, helps manage storage/bandwidth
- **Show seeders**: Yes, indicates stream reliability
- **Color coding**: Yes, makes quality tiers obvious

### Step 8: Performance & Caching

Speed up your experience with smart caching.

#### Enable Caching:
- **Cache search results** for 1 hour
- **Store up to 500 results** to avoid re-searching
- **Compress cached data** to save space

#### Performance Settings:
- **Enable background processing** for faster UI
- **Use multiple threads** if you have a powerful device
- **Limit concurrent scrapers** to avoid overwhelming your connection

### Step 9: Testing Your Setup

Let's make sure everything works:

<Steps>
1. **Save your configuration**
2. **Search for a popular movie** (like "The Matrix" or "Inception")
3. **Check the results** - you should see multiple streams from different scrapers
4. **Try different content types** - movies, TV shows, anime
5. **Test playback** - click a stream and see if it plays
6. **Adjust settings** if results aren't what you expected
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
**What to look for:**
- Multiple streams from different sources
- Color-coded quality indicators
- Reasonable search times (under 10 seconds)
- Streams that actually play when clicked
</Callout>

#### 1. API Keys Setup

AIOStream requires API keys for optimal functionality:

**TMDB (The Movie Database) API Key:**
- **Why needed**: For metadata, posters, and accurate content identification
- **How to get**: 
  1. Go to [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
  2. Create account if needed
  3. Request an API key (free)
  4. Copy the **"API Read Access Token"**

**Debrid Service API Keys:**
- **Real-Debrid**: Get from [https://real-debrid.com/apitoken](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken)
- **Premiumize**: Get from [https://www.premiumize.me/account](https://www.premiumize.me/account)
- **AllDebrid**: Get from [https://alldebrid.com/account](https://alldebrid.com/account)

#### 2. Scraper Configuration

This is where you configure which scrapers AIOStream will use:

```json
{
  "scrapers": [
    {
      "name": "torrentio",
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "comet",
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "mediafusion",
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**Recommended Scrapers to Enable:**
- **Torrentio** (Primary - best for debrid users)
- **Comet** (Fast torrent searches)
- **MediaFusion** (Direct streaming links)
- **Orionoid** (Premium torrent indexer)
- **Zilean** (Backup scraper)

### Step 10: Advanced Optimization (Optional)

Once your basic setup works, here are advanced tweaks for power users:

#### Multi-Debrid Setup:
If you have multiple debrid services, configure them with priorities:
1. **Real-Debrid** (usually fastest)
2. **Premiumize** (great for large files)
3. **AllDebrid** (good backup option)

#### Custom Regex Filtering:
For very specific filtering needs, use regex patterns:

**Block specific patterns:**
- `CAM|TS|TC|SCR` - Block camcorder recordings
- `\.avi$|\.divx$` - Block old file formats
- `^[0-1]\.[0-9]GB$` - Block files under 2GB
- `-GROUPNAME|ANOTHERGROUP` - Block specific release groups

#### Network Optimization:
- **VPN considerations**: Some scrapers work better with certain VPNs
- **Connection limits**: Reduce concurrent connections if you have slow internet
- **Retry logic**: Configure how many times to retry failed scrapers

### Step 11: Maintenance & Updates

Keep your AIOStream setup running smoothly:

#### Regular Maintenance:
- **Check for updates** weekly in the add-on catalog
- **Clear cache** if searches seem slow (monthly)
- **Verify API keys** are still active
- **Test different scrapers** if some stop working

#### When Things Go Wrong:
- **Try a different instance** if your current one is slow
- **Switch scrapers** if specific ones aren't working
- **Check Reddit/Discord** for known issues
- **Enable debug logging** to troubleshoot problems
