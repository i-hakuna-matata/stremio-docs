Stremio provides powerful tools to organize and track your viewing habits. This guide covers how to use your Library, Watchlist, and History effectively.

## Understanding the Three Systems

### Library

**What it is:**
- Your personal collection of content
- Content you've explicitly added
- Syncs across all your devices
- Shows progress for partially watched content

**When to use:**
- Content you're actively watching
- Shows you want to track
- Movies you plan to watch soon
- Content you want to keep organized

### Watchlist

**What it is:**
- Content you want to watch later
- Separate from your active library
- Good for "save for later" functionality
- Doesn't clutter your main library

**When to use:**
- Interesting content you find while browsing
- Recommendations you want to remember
- Content for specific moods or occasions
- Building a queue for future viewing

### History

**What it is:**
- Record of everything you've watched
- Automatically tracked by Stremio
- Includes watch dates and progress
- Private to your account

**When to use:**
- Finding content you watched before
- Tracking your viewing habits
- Resuming interrupted viewing sessions
- Discovering patterns in your preferences
