## The Main Interface

Stremio's interface has four main areas:

### 1. Sidebar (Left Side)

The sidebar contains your main navigation:

**🏠 Discover** — Browse content from your installed add-ons  
**📚 Library** — Your personal watchlist and viewing history  
**🔍 Search** — Find specific movies, shows, or videos  
**🧩 Add-ons** — Manage installed add-ons and browse new ones  
**⚙️ Settings** — Configure Stremio's behavior

<Callout type="tip">
On mobile/TV, the sidebar may be hidden by default. Tap the menu icon (☰) to open it.
</Callout>

### 2. Top Bar

Contains:
- **Search bar** (quick access without going to Search page)
- **Account menu** (your profile, sign out)
- **Notification bell** (updates, new add-on content)

### 3. Main Content Area

This is where pages load:
- Rows of content on Discover
- Your library items on Library page
- Search results on Search page
- Add-on lists on Add-ons page

### 4. Player (when watching)

Full-screen or windowed video player with:
- Playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume)
- Subtitle and audio track selection
- Quality settings
- Casting options (if available)

---

## Discover Page (Your Home)

The Discover page is what you see when you first open Stremio. It shows:

### Catalogs

Rows of content organized by:
- **Category** (Movies, TV Shows, Channels)
- **Genre** (Action, Comedy, Documentary, etc.)
- **Popularity** (Trending, Top Rated, Popular)
- **Source** (by add-on—e.g., "Trending on YouTube")

### How Discover Works

- **Content comes from your installed add-ons**
- More add-ons = more catalogs
- Catalogs update automatically when add-ons are added/removed

### Browsing Catalogs

- **Scroll horizontally** through each row
- **Click "See more"** to expand a row into a full page
- **Click any poster** to see details

<Callout type="note">
If your Discover page is empty, you need to install add-ons. See [Add-ons Explained](/addons/addons-explained/).
</Callout>

## Library Page (Your Collection)

Your Library has three tabs:

### 📖 Library

Content you've **actively added** to your collection:
- Click the **"+"** or bookmark icon on any title to add it here
- Useful for tracking what you want to watch

### 👁️ Continue Watching

Shows and movies you're **currently watching**:
- Automatically added when you start watching something
- Shows your progress (e.g., "S02E05, 15 minutes remaining")
- Click to resume where you left off

### 📜 History

**Everything you've watched**, in chronological order:
- Automatically tracked
- Can be cleared from Settings if needed

### Library Features

- **Sync across devices** (if you have an account)
- **Sort and filter** (by date added, title, etc.)
- **Remove items** (click the "..." menu on any title)

---

## Search Page

### How to Search

1. Click **Search** in sidebar, or
2. Use the search bar at the top (any page)

### What You Can Search For

- Movie titles
- TV show titles
- Actor names
- Director names
- YouTube channels (if YouTube add-on is installed)

### Search Results

- Results come from **all your installed add-ons**
- Click any result to see details
- If you don't see what you're looking for, check if you have relevant add-ons installed

<Callout type="tip">
**Search is only as good as your add-ons.** If you search for a movie and get no results, it means none of your installed add-ons have that movie in their catalogs.
</Callout>

## Content Detail Pages

When you click any movie or show, you'll see:

### Top Section

- **Poster/Backdrop**
- **Title and Release Year**

**Videos:** (for TV shows)

**Details:**
- Extended metadata (production companies, budget, etc.)

<Callout type="note">
**No streams available?** This means your add-ons don't have a source for this title. You may need to install different add-ons or the content simply isn't available.
</Callout>

## Common Navigation Mistakes

### ❌ Looking for content in Library before adding it

**Why it's bad:** Library only shows what you've manually added.

**What to do instead:** Use Discover or Search to find content, then add it to Library.

### ❌ Expecting all content to appear automatically

**Why it's bad:** Discover only shows content from installed add-ons.

**What to do instead:** Install relevant add-ons first. See [Add-ons Explained](/addons/addons-explained/).

### ❌ Clicking the first stream without checking alternatives

**Why it's bad:** The first stream might be low quality or unreliable.

**What to do instead:** Click the "Streams" tab, review all available sources, and pick the best one.

### ❌ Not using search (browsing catalogs instead)

**Why it's bad:** Browsing is inefficient if you know what you want.

**What to do instead:** Use the search bar for specific titles.

## Customization Tips

### Organize Your Library

- Add only content you actually want to track
- Use Continue Watching for in-progress items
- Clear History periodically if it gets cluttered (Settings → Advanced → Clear cache)

### Manage Your Add-ons

- Uninstall add-ons you don't use (reduces clutter on Discover page)
- Organize by priority (can't reorder, but you can uninstall/reinstall in preferred order)

### Adjust Player Settings

- Set preferred subtitle size and language in Settings
- Enable hardware acceleration if playback is choppy
