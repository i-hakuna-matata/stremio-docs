## What is the Web Version?

Stremio offers a web-based version at **[app.strem.io](https://app.strem.io)** that you can use directly in your browser without installing anything.

---

## How to Access

Simply open your web browser and go to:

**https://app.strem.io**

Supported browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

---

## Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
The web version has significant limitations compared to the desktop/mobile apps.
</Callout>

**What works:**
- ✅ Browsing catalogs
- ✅ Searching for content
- ✅ Managing your library
- ✅ Installing add-ons
- ✅ Watching some streams (depends on add-on and format)

**What doesn't work or works poorly:**
- ❌ Limited video format support (browser-dependent)
- ❌ No torrent streaming (most browsers)
- ❌ Reduced performance
- ❌ No offline capability
- ❌ Some add-ons may not work properly

---

## When to Use Web Version

**Good for:**
- Quick access to check your library
- Trying Stremio before installing
- Devices where you can't install apps (work computers, etc.)
- iOS devices (no native app available)

**Not good for:**
- Primary viewing device
- High-quality streaming
- Torrent-based add-ons

---

## Recommendation

If you have the option, **install the native app** for your platform instead. The web version is a fallback option, not the ideal way to use Stremio.

See [Installation Overview](/install/overview/) for native app options.

---

## iOS Users

Since Stremio has no native iOS app, the web version is your only option. It works in Safari on iPhone/iPad, but with the limitations listed above.

**Alternatives for iOS:**
- Install Stremio on a different device and cast to Apple TV
- Use a web browser on your computer/tablet and AirPlay to Apple TV
- Consider an Android TV device for better Stremio experience
