## Platforms NOT Supported

<Callout type="warning">
Stremio does NOT officially support the following platforms. Workarounds may exist but are not covered in this guide.
</Callout>

### ❌ iOS (iPhone/iPad)

**Why not:** Apple's App Store policies restrict apps like Stremio. There's no official iOS app.

**Workarounds:** 
- Use the web version (app.strem.io) in Safari—limited functionality
- Use third-party apps that integrate with Stremio (not officially supported)
- Install Stremio on a different device and cast to Apple TV

### ❌ Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Roku, etc.)

**Why not:** These platforms use proprietary operating systems. Stremio doesn't have native apps for them.

**Workarounds:**
- Use an **Android TV box** or **Fire TV Stick** (see [Android TV guide](/install/android-tv/))
- Cast from your phone or computer to the TV
- Use an HDMI cable to mirror your computer screen

### ❌ Game Consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo)

**Why not:** Stremio doesn't have console versions.

**Workarounds:**
- Cast from another device
- Use the console's web browser (if available) to access app.strem.io—highly limited

### ❌ Older Operating Systems

- **Windows:** XP, Vista (no longer supported)
- **macOS:** 10.10 Yosemite and earlier
- **Android:** Below 5.0 Lollipop

If you're on an older OS, you may need to upgrade or use a different device.

## Which Version Should I Install?

### Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Recommendation:** Install the **latest stable release** from the official Stremio website.

- ✅ Full features
- ✅ Best performance
- ✅ Regular updates

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Beta or development versions (unless you're an advanced user testing features)
- ❌ Unofficial third-party builds (security risk)

### Mobile (Android)

**Recommendation:** Install from **Google Play Store** if possible.

- ✅ Automatic updates
- ✅ Verified by Google
- ✅ Easiest to keep secure

**If Google Play isn't available (e.g., Fire tablets):**
- Download the official APK from stremio.com
- Verify the file signature (advanced)

### Android TV

**Recommendation:** Install the **dedicated Android TV version** from Google Play or the official APK.

- ✅ TV-optimized interface
- ✅ Remote control support
- ✅ Better performance on TV hardware

**Don't install:**
- ❌ The phone/tablet version on your TV (it'll work but the UI is not optimized)

---

## Security Best Practices

Before and during installation:

### ✅ DO:

- **Download only from official sources** (stremio.com or official app stores)
- **Verify file checksums** if you're technically inclined
- **Keep your OS updated** before installing
- **Use antivirus/antimalware software** (especially on Windows)
- **Read permission requests** before granting access

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Download from third-party sites** (risk of malware)
- **Disable your firewall or antivirus** to install (if required, something is wrong)
- **Install cracked or "modified" versions** (huge security risk)
- **Skip reading what the installer asks for** (permissions, install location, etc.)

<Callout type="legal">
Only install Stremio from official sources. Third-party versions may contain malware, spyware, or unwanted modifications.
