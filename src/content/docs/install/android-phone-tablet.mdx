## Before You Begin

- Supported devices: Android 5.0+ phones and tablets, Fire OS tablets (via APK), and most custom ROMs with Google Play Services.
- Make sure you have **at least 500 MB free** so Stremio can store cache.
- Connect to **Wi-Fi** if possible—installing via mobile data may be slow or limited.
- Sign in with a Google account if you plan to use the Play Store.

<Callout type="warning">
Never download "modded" or "premium" APKs from unofficial mirrors. They frequently contain spyware or cryptocurrency miners.
</Callout>

## Method 1: Google Play Store (Recommended)

<Steps>

1. **Open Google Play Store** on your Android device

2. **Search for "Stremio"**

3. **Tap "Install"** on the Stremio app by Stremio

4. **Wait for installation** to complete

5. **Tap "Open"** to launch Stremio

</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
Double-check that the publisher listed under the install button is **"Stremio"** (Smart Code OOD). Imitation entries sometimes appear in search results.
</Callout>

## Method 2: APK File (for devices without Google Play)

<Callout type="warning">
Only install APKs from official sources. Use this method only if Google Play is not available on your device.
</Callout>

<Steps>

1. **Enable Unknown Sources**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Security**
   - Enable **"Unknown sources"** or **"Install unknown apps"**

2. **Download the APK**
   - On your device, go to [https://www.stremio.com](https://www.stremio.com)
   - Tap **"Download for Android"**
   - Save the APK file

3. **Install the APK**
   - Open your **Downloads** folder
   - Tap the **Stremio APK** file
   - Tap **"Install"**
   - Wait for installation

4. **Disable Unknown Sources** (recommended for security)

5. **Launch Stremio** from your app drawer

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
On Fire OS tablets, open the Silk browser, visit <code>stremio.com</code>, and follow the same APK installation steps. For Huawei devices without Google services, use the APK method and allow "Install unknown apps" for your browser.
</Callout>

## System Requirements

- Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer
- 2 GB RAM minimum (4 GB recommended)
- 200 MB free storage

---

## Verify the Download

1. After downloading the APK, compare its SHA-256 checksum with the value posted on [stremio.com/downloads](https://www.stremio.com/downloads).  
2. Use an app like **Hash Droid** or run `sha256sum Stremio.apk` via Termux to calculate the hash.  
3. If the values don't match, delete the file immediately and download again—do **not** install it.

---

## Manage Permissions on First Launch

During the first run, Android may prompt you for:

- **Notifications:** Optional. Enable if you want release alerts or binge-watching reminders.
- **Storage (Android 5/6):** Needed only for caching streams locally. On Android 11+, scoped storage is used automatically.
- **Battery optimization exclusions:** Decline unless you notice background sync being interrupted.

You can revisit permissions under **Settings → Apps → Stremio → Permissions** anytime.

---

## Keep the App Updated

- **Play Store version:** Updates automatically when Wi-Fi + charging (default behavior). You can force update via Play Store → Manage apps → Updates.
- **APK side-load:** Check [stremio.com](https://www.stremio.com) monthly for new releases. Download the new APK and install it over the old one (no need to uninstall).
- **Fire OS Appstore clones:** If you sideloaded via APKPure/Aurora, disable auto-update services from unknown sources to avoid mismatched variants.

<Callout type="warning">
Mixing Play Store and side-loaded builds on the same device can cause signature mismatches. Stick to one distribution method per device.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Installation Errors

### "Play Protect blocked this app"
- Tap **Details** → **Install anyway** only if you downloaded from the official Play listing.
- If side-loading, Play Protect may flag unsigned APKs. Temporarily disable real-time scanning, install, then re-enable protection.

### "App not installed" when side-loading
- Delete any previously downloaded APK with a different signature.
- Clear the installer cache: **Settings → Apps → Package installer → Storage → Clear cache**.
- Ensure "Install unknown apps" permission is granted to both your browser and file manager.

### "Can't open file" in Downloads
- Use a dedicated file manager (Files by Google).  
- Move the APK to internal storage (not SD card) before installing. Some OEMs block installations from external SD cards.

### Stremio crashes on launch
- Restart the device, then clear the app cache via **Settings → Apps → Stremio → Storage → Clear cache**.
- Older devices (Android 5/6) may need WebView updates from the Play Store to render the UI.
