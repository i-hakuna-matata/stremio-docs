## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Installing from an unofficial source

**Why it's bad:** Risk of malware, viruses, or modified versions.

**How to avoid:** Only download from **stremio.com**. If you Googled "Stremio download" and clicked an ad or third-party site, you might have the wrong file.

### ❌ Skipping the firewall prompt

**Why it's bad:** Stremio won't be able to stream if Windows blocks it.

**How to fix:** 
1. Go to **Windows Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Windows Security** → **Firewall & network protection**
2. Click **"Allow an app through firewall"**
3. Find Stremio in the list and check both **Private** and **Public** boxes
4. Restart Stremio

### ❌ Installing on a full hard drive

**Why it's bad:** Installation will fail or Stremio won't have space for cache.

**How to avoid:** Check free space before installing (see [System Check](#system-check) above).

### ❌ Not updating Windows first

**Why it's bad:** Stremio may not run properly on an outdated Windows install.

**How to avoid:** Run Windows Update before installing Stremio.
