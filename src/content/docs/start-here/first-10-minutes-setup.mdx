## What You'll Do

This guide walks you through the essential first steps after installing Stremio:

1. Create an account (optional but recommended)

---

## Before You Start

**Prerequisites:**

- You've read [What is Stremio?](/start-here/what-is-stremio/) and [Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/)
- You've installed Stremio on your device (if not, see [Installation Overview](/install/overview/))
- You have a stable internet connection

**What you'll need:**

- An email address (for creating an account)
- 10-15 minutes of uninterrupted time

---

## Step 1: Launch Stremio

<Steps>

1. **Open the Stremio app** on your device

   - **Windows/Mac/Linux:** Find it in your Applications folder or Start menu
   - **Android/Android TV:** Tap the Stremio icon on your home screen
   - **Web:** Navigate to app.strem.io in your browser

2. **Wait for the welcome screen to load**

   You'll see the Stremio logo and a welcome message.

3. **Choose your language** (if prompted)

   Select your preferred language from the dropdown.

</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
First launch may take 10-20 seconds as Stremio initializes. This is normal.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Create an Account (Recommended)

You can use Stremio without an account, but creating one enables:

- **Syncing** your library across devices
- **Backup** of your settings and add-ons
- **Continuity** (resume watching on any device)

<Steps>

1. **Click "Sign Up" or "Create Account"** on the welcome screen

2. **Enter your email address**

   - Use a real email—you'll need to verify it
   - Your email is used only for account recovery (not marketing)

3. **Choose a strong password**

   - At least 8 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords from other services

4. **Click "Create Account"**

5. **Check your email** for a verification link

   - Check your spam folder if you don't see it within a few minutes

6. **Click the verification link**

   This confirms your email and activates your account.

7. **Return to Stremio**

   You should now be logged in automatically.

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**No account?** You can click "Skip" or "Continue without account." Your data will stay local to your device, and you won't be able to sync. You can create an account later from Settings.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

Let's set up safe defaults before you start exploring.

<Steps>

1. **Open Settings**

   - Look for the **gear icon** (⚙️) in the top-right corner
   - Click it to open the settings menu

2. **Review these key settings:**

   **General Tab:**
   - **Language:** Confirm your preferred language
   - **Hardware acceleration:** Leave enabled (helps with playback performance)

   **Player Tab:**
   - **Default audio language:** Choose your language (e.g., English)
   - **Default subtitle language:** Choose your language or "None"
   - **Subtitle size:** Medium (you can adjust later)

   **Streaming Tab:**
   - **Cache size:** 2GB (default is fine for most users)
   - **Torrent connections:** Default (don't change unless you know what you're doing)

   **Privacy Tab:**
   - **Send anonymous analytics:** Your choice (helps developers, but you can disable)
   - **Binge watching notifications:** Your choice (reminds you to take breaks)

3. **Click "Save" or close Settings**

   Changes are saved automatically in most versions.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't change advanced settings** (like network ports or proxy settings) unless you know what you're doing. Incorrect settings can break streaming.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Install Your First Safe Add-on

Let's install a 100% legal, safe add-on to test Stremio's functionality.

We'll use **YouTube** as an example (it's pre-installed or easy to add, and it's definitely legal).

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to the Add-ons page**

   - Click the **puzzle piece icon** (🧩) in the sidebar, or
   - Click "Add-ons" in the main menu

2. **Look for the YouTube add-on**

   - It might already be installed (you'll see "Installed" or "Uninstall" button)
   - If not, scroll through the "Community Add-ons" section

3. **Click "Install" next to YouTube**

   - A confirmation dialog may appear
   - Click "Install" or "OK"

4. **Wait for installation to complete**

   - Should take just a few seconds
   - You'll see a success message

5. **Verify it's installed**

   - Go to the "Installed" tab in Add-ons
   - You should see "YouTube" listed

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**Other safe first add-ons to try:**
- **Cinemeta** (metadata for movies/TV—usually pre-installed)
- **OpenSubtitles** (free subtitles—useful if you need accessibility or language options)
- **Podcasts** or **Twitch** (if you're interested in that content)
</Callout>

## Step 5: Test Streaming

Now let's make sure everything works.

<Steps>

1. **Go to the Discover page**

   - Click the **home icon** (🏠) or "Discover" in the sidebar

2. **You should see content from YouTube**

   - Rows like "Trending on YouTube," "Music," etc.
   - If you installed Cinemeta, you'll also see movie/TV categories

3. **Click on any video or show**

   - A detail page will open with a description and poster

4. **Click "Play" or click on a stream source**

   - The video should start playing in Stremio's built-in player

5. **Test basic playback controls**

   - Pause/play (spacebar or on-screen button)
   - Volume (up/down arrows or slider)
   - Fullscreen (F key or button)
   - Seek/rewind (left/right arrows)

</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
**If playback doesn't work:** Don't worry—check the [Troubleshooting Overview](/troubleshooting/overview/) or [Playback & Buffering](/troubleshooting/playback-buffering/) guide.
</Callout>

## Step 6: Explore the Interface

Take 5 minutes to familiarize yourself with Stremio's layout:

### Main Areas

- **Discover:** Browse recommended content from your installed add-ons
- **Library:** Your personal watchlist and viewing history
- **Search:** Find specific movies, shows, or videos
- **Add-ons:** Manage installed add-ons and browse new ones
- **Settings:** Customize Stremio's behavior

### What to Try

- **Add something to your Library:** Click the "+" or bookmark icon on any title
- **Search for something:** Use the search bar at the top
- **Browse by category:** Scroll through genres and collections on the Discover page

For a detailed walkthrough, see [Navigation Basics](/using-stremio/navigation-basics/).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Here are the most common errors beginners make in their first session:

### ❌ Installing too many add-ons at once

**Why it's bad:** Hard to troubleshoot if something breaks; increases security risk.

**What to do instead:** Install one or two add-ons at a time. Test them before adding more.

### ❌ Skipping account creation and regretting it later

**Why it's bad:** You'll lose your library if you uninstall Stremio or switch devices.

**What to do instead:** Create an account now. It takes 2 minutes.

### ❌ Ignoring add-on descriptions and installing blindly

**Why it's bad:** You might install something unsafe or illegal.

**What to do instead:** Always read what an add-on does before installing. When in doubt, Google it.

### ❌ Changing advanced settings without understanding them

**Why it's bad:** Can break playback, cause buffering, or create security issues.

**What to do instead:** Stick to default settings until you're comfortable and know why you need to change something.

### ❌ Not testing playback with a safe add-on first

**Why it's bad:** If something doesn't work, you won't know if it's a Stremio issue or an add-on issue.

**What to do instead:** Test with YouTube or another official add-on before trying anything else.

## How to Undo / Rollback

If something goes wrong during setup, here's how to reset:

### Uninstall an Add-on

1. Go to **Add-ons** → **Installed**
2. Click "Uninstall" next to the add-on you want to remove
3. Confirm

### Reset Settings to Default

1. Go to **Settings** → **Advanced** (or **General** depending on version)
2. Look for "Reset to defaults" or "Clear cache"
3. Click it and confirm

### Log Out and Start Over

1. Go to **Settings** → **Account**
2. Click "Log Out"
3. Restart Stremio and go through setup again

### Completely Uninstall and Reinstall

If all else fails:

1. Uninstall Stremio from your device (like any other app)
2. Delete the Stremio data folder (location varies by OS—Google "Stremio data folder [your OS]")
3. Reinstall Stremio from the official website
4. Start fresh

<Callout type="warning">
Uninstalling Stremio will delete local data (unless you have an account and it's synced to the cloud).
</Callout>
