## What You'll Learn

By the end of this page, you'll understand what Stremio is, how it works, what makes it different from other apps, and whether it's the right choice for you.

---

## The Simple Explanation

**Stremio is a media center application**—think of it like a smart TV interface for your computer, phone, or streaming device. It lets you:

- **Browse** movies, TV shows, YouTube channels, and podcasts in one place
- **Organize** your watchlist and viewing history
- **Stream** content directly without downloading files
- **Sync** your library across all your devices

Stremio itself **does not host or provide any video content**. Instead, it works with **add-ons** (small plugins) that connect to different sources of content.

---

## How It Works

Here's the basic flow:

1. **You install Stremio** on your device (computer, phone, TV stick, etc.)
2. **You install add-ons** that tell Stremio where to find content
3. **You browse and search** for movies or shows within Stremio
4. **Stremio uses the add-ons** to find and stream the content
5. **You watch** directly in Stremio's built-in player

<Callout type="note">
Stremio is like a web browser for video content. Just as a browser doesn't create websites, Stremio doesn't create video—it simply organizes and displays what add-ons provide.

## What Makes Stremio Different?

### Compared to Netflix or Disney+

- **Stremio is not a streaming service**—it doesn't have its own content library or subscription
- **You choose your sources** by installing add-ons
- **No monthly fee** for the app itself (though some add-ons might require paid services)

### Compared to Plex or Kodi

- **Stremio focuses on streaming**, not local media files (though it can play them)
- **Simpler setup**—no media server required
- **Automatic syncing** across devices with a free account
- **Smaller, lighter app** with a modern interface

### Compared to Popcorn Time

- **More flexible**—you control which add-ons you use
- **Still actively maintained** with regular updates
- **Cross-platform**—works on more devices
- **Built-in safety features** like the ability to easily uninstall add-ons

## What Stremio Is NOT

Let's clear up some common misconceptions:

❌ **Stremio is not a piracy app**  
It's a neutral tool. What you do with it depends on the add-ons you choose.

❌ **Stremio is not illegal**  
The software itself is 100% legal. Using it to access copyrighted content without authorization is illegal in most jurisdictions.

❌ **Stremio does not include content by default**  
A fresh install has no video sources. You must add them via add-ons.

❌ **Stremio is not a VPN or privacy tool**  
It does not hide your activity. If privacy matters to you, use separate privacy tools (we cover this in [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/)).

❌ **Stremio is not "set and forget"**  
Add-ons can break, sources can go offline, and you may need to troubleshoot occasionally.

---

## Who Should Use Stremio?

Stremio is a good fit if you:

✅ Want a **unified interface** for all your streaming sources  
✅ Are comfortable **installing and managing add-ons**  
✅ Value **cross-device syncing** without a complicated setup  
✅ Prefer **streaming over downloading** files  
✅ Want to use **legal sources** like YouTube, podcasts, and public domain content in one app  

Stremio might NOT be ideal if you:

⚠️ Only want a plug-and-play experience with zero setup  
⚠️ Need enterprise-level support or guarantees  
⚠️ Want to organize a large personal media library (Plex or Jellyfin might be better)

## Is Stremio Safe and Legal?

### The Software Itself

- **Safe:** Stremio is open-source and regularly updated. The official app from stremio.com is clean.
- **Legal:** Downloading and using Stremio is legal worldwide.

### The Add-ons You Install

This is where things vary:

- **Some add-ons are 100% legal** (e.g., YouTube, public domain catalogs, official network add-ons)
- **Some add-ons provide access to copyrighted content** without authorization—using these is illegal in most countries
- **You are responsible** for evaluating the add-ons you install

<Callout type="legal">
**Key principle:** Stremio itself is legal and safe. Your use of it can be legal or illegal depending on your choices. This guide will help you make informed decisions, but it cannot replace legal advice for your specific situation.
