## Special Scenarios

### I'm Setting Up Stremio for Someone Else

**If you're helping a parent, grandparent, or non-technical friend:**

1. Read **[Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/)** yourself first
2. Install Stremio and configure it for them following **[First 10 Minutes Setup](/start-here/first-10-minutes-setup/)**
3. Only install **safe, legal add-ons** (YouTube, podcasts, etc.)
4. Show them **[Navigation Basics](/using-stremio/navigation-basics/)** in person
5. Write down or bookmark these pages for them:
   - [How to Install & Remove Add-ons Safely](/addons/how-to-install-remove-addons-safely/)
   - [Troubleshooting Overview](/troubleshooting/overview/)
   - [FAQ](/faq/faq/)
6. Periodically check in and audit their installed add-ons

**For kids:** Also read [Accessibility Settings](/using-stremio/accessibility-settings/) for parental controls and content filtering ideas.

---

### I'm Migrating from Another App (Kodi, Plex, etc.)

**If you're coming from a different media center:**

1. Read **[What is Stremio?](/start-here/what-is-stremio/)**—understand the differences
2. Install Stremio: **[Installation Overview](/install/overview/)**
3. Understand add-ons: **[Add-ons Explained](/addons/addons-explained/)**
4. If you care about organization: **[Metadata Explained](/metadata/metadata-explained/)**
5. If you have sync/multi-device needs: **[Sync & Multiple Devices](/using-stremio/sync-and-multiple-devices/)**

**Key differences to know:**

- Stremio focuses on **streaming**, not local media libraries
- Add-ons are **simpler to install** than Kodi add-ons (but similar concept)
- Syncing is **built-in and free** (unlike Plex's free tier limitations)
- Customization is **more limited** than Kodi but easier to use

---

### I Only Want Legal, Safe Usage

**If you're committed to using Stremio 100% legally:**

1. Read **[Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/)**
2. Install only these types of add-ons:
   - **[Catalogs & Metadata Add-ons](/addons/catalogs-and-metadata-addons/)** (organizational tools)
   - **[Subtitle Add-ons](/addons/subtitles-addons-legal-notes/)** (legal sources only)
   - Official sources like YouTube, Twitch, podcasts
3. Use Stremio as a **catalog and tracking tool** for content you watch on other platforms
4. Regularly audit your add-ons: **[Avoiding Suspicious Add-ons](/privacy-security/avoiding-suspicious-addons/)**

**This is a valid use case!** Stremio's interface and syncing are valuable even if you're not streaming pirated content.

## Tips for Learning

### Don't Rush

Stremio has a lot of features. It's okay to:

- Take breaks
- Read one section at a time
- Revisit pages as you need them

### Bookmark What You Need

Use your browser's bookmarks to save:

- Pages you refer to often (like Troubleshooting)
- Your specific device's install guide
- The FAQ and Glossary

### Try Things Out

**Reading alone won't make you proficient.** As you read:

- Install the add-ons mentioned in examples
- Click around the interface
- Test features like search, library, and syncing

### Ask for Help When Stuck

If something doesn't make sense:

- Re-read the relevant section slowly
- Check the Glossary for unfamiliar terms
- Search the documentation site
- Ask in the Stremio community (see [Reporting Issues & Scams](/privacy-security/reporting-issues-and-scams/))

---

## Common Questions at This Stage

### "Do I really need to read all this?"

**No.** You can use Stremio with just the basics. But reading more helps you:

- Avoid common mistakes
- Troubleshoot faster
- Stay safe and legal
- Get the most out of Stremio's features

**Suggested minimum reading:**

- Start Here section (you've done this)
- Your device's install guide
- Navigation Basics
- Add-ons Explained
- Privacy Basics

---

### "Can I skip the safety/legal stuff?"

**You can, but you shouldn't.** It's the most important content in this guide. Even if you plan to use Stremio legally, understanding the risks helps you:

- Recognize when something isn't safe
- Make informed decisions about add-ons
- Avoid accidentally installing something harmful

**It takes 20 minutes. Just do it.**

---

### "I'm overwhelmed. Where do I start?"

**Start small:**

1. Read just **[Navigation Basics](/using-stremio/navigation-basics/)** (10 min)
2. Install **one safe add-on** like YouTube
3. Use Stremio for a few days
4. Come back and read more when you're ready

**You don't have to master everything today.**
