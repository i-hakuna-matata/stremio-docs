## Core Concepts

### Stremio

**What it is:** The media center app you're using—the software that organizes and plays content.

**Why it matters:** Stremio itself doesn't host content; it's just the interface. Everything you see comes from add-ons.

**Think of it like:** A web browser for video content.

---

### Add-on

**What it is:** A plugin or extension that connects Stremio to a source of content (movies, shows, streams, metadata, etc.).

**Why it matters:** Add-ons are how Stremio gets content. No add-ons = no content.

**Examples:** YouTube (videos), Cinemeta (metadata), OpenSubtitles (subtitles).

**Learn more:** [Add-ons Explained](/addons/addons-explained/)

---

### Catalog

**What it is:** A collection or list of movies, shows, or videos provided by an add-on.

**Why it matters:** When you browse the Discover page, you're seeing catalogs from your installed add-ons.

**Example:** The "Trending on YouTube" row is a catalog from the YouTube add-on.

**Think of it like:** A shelf in a library—each add-on has its own shelves (catalogs).

---

### Metadata

**What it is:** Information *about* a movie or show—like the poster, title, description, cast, release date, and ratings.

**Why it matters:** Metadata makes Stremio look polished and helps you decide what to watch. It's separate from the actual video stream.

**Example:** When you see a nice poster and plot summary for a movie, that's metadata.

**Learn more:** [Metadata Explained](/metadata/metadata-explained/)

---

### Stream

**What it is:** A playable source for a video—the actual file or link that Stremio will use to play content.

**Why it matters:** When you click "Play" on a movie, Stremio asks your add-ons to find streams. You pick which stream to use (or Stremio picks automatically).

**Example:** A stream might be a torrent link, a direct video file, or a YouTube URL.

**Think of it like:** Different TV channels broadcasting the same show—each stream is a different "channel."

---

### Library

**What it is:** Your personal collection in Stremio—the movies and shows you've added to your watchlist or marked as watched.

**Why it matters:** Your library syncs across devices (if you have an account) and helps you keep track of what you're watching.

**How to use it:** Click the "+" or bookmark icon on any title to add it to your library.

**Learn more:** [Library, Watchlist & History](/using-stremio/library-watchlist-history/)

---

## Streaming & Playback

### Buffering

**What it is:** When the video pauses to load more data before continuing playback.

**Why it matters:** Excessive buffering is frustrating. It usually means your internet is too slow, unstable, or the stream source is overloaded.

**How to fix it:** See [Playback & Buffering](/troubleshooting/playback-buffering/)

---

### Torrent

**What it is:** A peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. Instead of downloading from one server, you download pieces from many users at once.

**Why it matters:** Some add-ons use torrents as stream sources. **Important:** Torrenting copyrighted content without permission is illegal in most countries.

**How it works in Stremio:** Stremio streams torrents directly (you don't download the full file), but your IP is still visible to others in the torrent swarm.

**Safety note:** Using torrent-based add-ons for copyrighted content is a legal and privacy risk.

---

### Debrid Service

**What it is:** A paid service (e.g., Real-Debrid, AllDebrid) that downloads torrents or file-host links to its servers, then streams them to you at high speed.

**Why it matters:** Debrid services can improve speed and reduce buffering, but they're often used to access pirated content.

**Legal note:** Using a debrid service for content you don't have rights to is still illegal.

**This guide's stance:** We explain what debrid is but don't provide setup instructions for piracy use cases.

---

### Subtitles

**What it is:** Text displayed on-screen that transcribes or translates the audio.

**Why it matters:** Essential for accessibility (deaf/hard of hearing) and language learning.

**How to use in Stremio:** Add a subtitle add-on (like OpenSubtitles), then enable subtitles in the player settings.

**Learn more:** [Player, Subtitles & Audio](/using-stremio/player-settings-subtitles-audio/)

---

## Account & Syncing

### Stremio Account

**What it is:** A free account you create with Stremio (using an email and password) that lets you sync your library and settings.

**Why it matters:** Without an account, your data stays local to your device. With an account, you can seamlessly switch between devices.

**How to create:** See [First 10 Minutes Setup](/start-here/first-10-minutes-setup/)

---

### Sync / Syncing

**What it is:** The automatic process of keeping your library, watchlist, and settings the same across all your devices.

**Why it matters:** Start watching on your laptop, finish on your TV—your progress follows you.

**How it works:** When you have a Stremio account, your data is stored in the cloud and syncs automatically.

**Learn more:** [Sync & Multiple Devices](/using-stremio/sync-and-multiple-devices/)

---

## Content Types

### Movie

**What it is:** A standalone film (as opposed to an episodic TV show).

**Why it matters:** Self-explanatory, but Stremio organizes movies and TV shows separately.

---

### TV Show / Series

**What it is:** Episodic content organized into seasons and episodes.

**Why it matters:** Stremio tracks which episodes you've watched and lets you binge-watch easily.

---

### Channel

**What it is:** In the context of YouTube or Twitch add-ons, a "channel" is a creator's collection of videos or streams.

**Why it matters:** You can subscribe to channels within Stremio (via add-ons) and see new uploads.

---

### Live TV

**What it is:** Real-time streaming of television broadcasts (like news or sports).

**Why it matters:** Some add-ons provide live TV channels. Legal availability varies by region.

---

## Technical Terms (Simplified)

### HTTPS / HTTP

**What it is:** Protocols for transferring data over the internet. HTTPS is secure (encrypted), HTTP is not.

**Why it matters:** Secure add-ons and streams use HTTPS. If an add-on uses HTTP, your activity might be visible to others.

---

### IP Address

**What it is:** A unique number that identifies your device on the internet (like a home address).

**Why it matters:** When you stream (especially torrents), other users can see your IP. This is a privacy concern.

**How to protect it:** Use a VPN (though this has legal and ethical considerations—see [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/)).

---

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

**What it is:** A service that encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP address by routing traffic through a server in another location.

**Why it matters:** Some users use VPNs to hide streaming activity from their ISP or to bypass geo-restrictions.

**Legal note:** A VPN doesn't make illegal streaming legal—it just hides it.

**This guide's stance:** We explain what VPNs are but don't promote using them to evade copyright law.

---

### Cache

**What it is:** Temporary data stored on your device to speed up loading times.

**Why it matters:** Stremio caches posters, metadata, and stream data. Clearing the cache can fix some bugs.

**How to clear it:** Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache

---

### Sideloading

**What it is:** Installing an app from outside the official app store (e.g., installing an APK file on Android instead of using Google Play).

**Why it matters:** Some Stremio add-ons or unofficial versions require sideloading. **Be careful**—this can be a security risk.

**Safety note:** Only sideload from trusted sources. Never disable device security to install something.

---

## Safety & Legal Terms

### Copyright

**What it is:** Legal protection for creative works (movies, music, books, etc.). Copyright holders have exclusive rights to distribute and profit from their work.

**Why it matters:** Streaming or sharing copyrighted content without permission is illegal.

---

### Piracy

**What it is:** Unauthorized copying, distribution, or streaming of copyrighted content.

**Why it matters:** Many Stremio add-ons facilitate piracy. Using them is illegal and risky.

**This guide's stance:** We teach you how to *avoid* piracy, not how to do it.

---

### DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)

**What it is:** A U.S. law that penalizes copyright infringement online.

**Why it matters:** ISPs in the U.S. can send DMCA notices if you're caught streaming or torrenting copyrighted content.

**What to do if you get one:** Stop the activity, delete the content, and review [Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/).

---

### ISP (Internet Service Provider)

**What it is:** The company that provides your internet connection (e.g., Comcast, Verizon, BT, Telstra).

**Why it matters:** Your ISP can see your streaming activity (unless you use a VPN). They can throttle, warn, or even suspend your service if you violate their terms.

---

### Malware

**What it is:** Malicious software designed to harm your device, steal data, or spy on you.

**Why it matters:** Fake or untrustworthy add-ons can contain malware.

**How to avoid it:** Only install add-ons from trusted sources. See [Avoiding Suspicious Add-ons](/privacy-security/avoiding-suspicious-addons/).

---

## Common Abbreviations

- **TV:** Television
- **VOD:** Video on Demand
- **P2P:** Peer-to-Peer (like torrents)
- **IPTV:** Internet Protocol Television (streaming live TV over the internet)
- **UI:** User Interface (what you see and interact with)
- **API:** Application Programming Interface (how add-ons talk to services)
- **OS:** Operating System (Windows, macOS, Android, etc.)
