## The Legal Landscape

### What IS Legal

✅ **Installing and using Stremio**  
The software itself is legal everywhere. It's a neutral media player.

✅ **Using add-ons that provide licensed content**  
Examples: Official network add-ons, YouTube, Twitch, podcasts, public domain content, Creative Commons libraries.

✅ **Using add-ons for content you own**  
If you legally own or subscribe to content, using an add-on to access it is generally fine (check the service's terms of service).

✅ **Using metadata add-ons**  
Add-ons that only provide information (posters, descriptions, ratings) without streaming links are legal.

### What IS Illegal (in Most Jurisdictions)

❌ **Streaming copyrighted content without authorization**  
This includes movies, TV shows, sports, and other content you don't have legal rights to access.

❌ **Using add-ons designed to access pirated content**  
Even if you're "just streaming" and not downloading, it's still copyright infringement in most countries.

❌ **Redistributing copyrighted streams**  
Sharing or reselling access to pirated content is illegal and often prosecuted more aggressively.

<Callout type="warning">
**Common misconception:** "Streaming isn't illegal, only downloading is."  

**Reality:** In most countries (including the US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia), streaming copyrighted content without permission is illegal. The risk of prosecution is lower than for distributors, but the law is clear.
</Callout>

### The Gray Areas

Some situations are legally ambiguous:

- **Content you pay for but access via third-party add-ons** (e.g., using a debrid service with content from a paid subscription)
- **Geo-restricted content** (accessing a service available in your country but blocked in your current location)
- **Content with unclear licensing** (old shows, abandoned projects)

When in doubt, **assume it's not legal** unless you can verify otherwise.

## Understanding Add-on Risk Levels

Not all add-ons carry the same risk. Here's how to think about them:

### 🟢 Low Risk: Metadata & Catalogs

These add-ons provide **information only**—no streams.

- **Examples:** Metadata add-ons (AIOMetadata-style), TMDB catalogs, genre filters
- **What they do:** Show posters, descriptions, ratings, and organize content
- **Legal status:** Completely legal
- **Safety:** Generally safe if from trusted sources

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Licensed & Official Sources

These add-ons stream content but from legitimate sources.

- **Examples:** YouTube, Twitch, official network add-ons, podcast directories
- **What they do:** Stream freely available or licensed content
- **Legal status:** Legal (as long as you comply with the source's terms of service)
- **Safety:** Usually safe, but verify the add-on is actually official

### 🔴 High Risk: Unlicensed Streaming

These add-ons provide streams of copyrighted content without authorization.

- **Examples:** We won't name them, but if an add-on promises "free movies and TV," it likely falls here
- **What they do:** Scrape torrent sites, file hosts, or pirate streaming services
- **Legal status:** Illegal in most jurisdictions
- **Safety:** High risk of malware, data harvesting, and legal consequences

<Callout type="legal">
**This guide's stance:** We explain how add-ons work and how to remove unsafe ones, but we do not provide step-by-step instructions for installing or configuring add-ons designed for unauthorized streaming. For safety/risk information on specific add-ons, see the [Add-ons section](/addons/addons-explained/).

## Real-World Consequences

### What Could Happen If You Use Illegal Add-ons?

The risks vary by country and situation:

#### Legal Risks

- **Copyright notices** from your internet provider (ISP)
- **ISP throttling or service suspension**
- **Fines** (in some EU countries, fines can be €300–€1,000 for individual streamers)
- **Legal action** (rare for individual users, but it happens)

**Reality check:** Most individual users face ISP warnings rather than lawsuits. However, laws are tightening in many countries, and enforcement is increasing.

#### Privacy Risks

- **Your ISP can see what you stream** (unless you use a VPN, which has its own legal/ethical considerations)
- **Add-ons may log your activity** and sell it to third parties
- **Your data may be exposed** if the add-on is compromised

#### Security Risks

- **Malware and spyware** disguised as add-ons
- **Phishing attacks** via fake add-on sites
- **Device compromise** (especially on Android TV sticks with sideloaded apps)

---

## How to Identify Risky Add-ons

Before installing any add-on, ask yourself:

### Red Flags 🚩

- **Promises "unlimited free movies and TV"**—if it sounds too good to be true, it is
- **Requires payment or subscription**—legitimate free add-ons don't charge
- **Asks for excessive permissions** (access to contacts, files, location)
- **No clear developer or source**—you can't verify who made it
- **Promoted on shady websites** or through spam
- **Requires sideloading or disabling security features**

### Green Flags ✅

- **Clear, reputable developer** (e.g., official Stremio community, known open-source project)
- **Open-source code** you can inspect (if you're technical or trust others who have)
- **Transparent about what it does** (metadata only, official APIs, etc.)
- **Available through Stremio's built-in add-on catalog** (some curation, though not perfect)
- **Positive reputation** in trusted communities

<Callout type="tip">
**Rule of thumb:** If you have to Google "is [add-on name] safe?", it's probably not worth the risk.
</Callout>

## Privacy Basics

### What Stremio Itself Collects

Stremio (the official app) collects:

- **Account email** (if you create an account)
- **Usage analytics** (anonymized, can be disabled in settings)
- **Add-on preferences and library data** (stored on Stremio's servers if you sync)

Stremio does **not** collect or share what you watch via add-ons. Your streaming activity is between you and the add-on.

### What Add-ons Might Collect

This varies widely:

- **Metadata add-ons:** Usually just your queries (what you search for)
- **Streaming add-ons:** May log your IP address, viewing history, device info, and more
- **Malicious add-ons:** Can collect anything your device allows them to access

<Callout type="warning">
Installing an add-on is like installing a browser extension—you're trusting the developer with access to your data. Choose carefully.
</Callout>

### How to Protect Your Privacy

1. **Only install add-ons from trusted sources** (see [Avoiding Suspicious Add-ons](/privacy-security/avoiding-suspicious-addons/))
2. **Review add-on permissions** before installing (when possible)
3. **Use a VPN** if you're concerned about ISP monitoring (legal considerations apply)
4. **Regularly audit your installed add-ons** and remove ones you don't use
5. **Keep Stremio and your OS updated** to patch security vulnerabilities

## How to Use Stremio Legally

Here's a framework for staying on the right side of the law:

### Option 1: Use Only Legal Add-ons

Stick to add-ons that provide:

- Licensed content (YouTube, Twitch, official channels)
- Public domain content
- Your own media (via DLNA or local streaming)
- Metadata and organization (no streams)

**Pros:** No legal risk, no ethical concerns  
**Cons:** Limited content compared to commercial streaming services

### Option 2: Pair Stremio with Paid Services

Use Stremio as an interface for services you already pay for:

- Some users integrate Netflix, Disney+, etc. via browser add-ons or workarounds (check terms of service)
- Use debrid services **only for content you legally own** (e.g., personal backups)

**Pros:** Legal, supports creators  
**Cons:** Costs money, may violate service ToS depending on method

### Option 3: Stick to Metadata and Organization

Use Stremio as a **catalog and tracking tool** without streaming:

- Install metadata add-ons to browse and organize
- Use Stremio to track what you want to watch
- Watch content on official platforms (link out from Stremio)

**Pros:** Completely legal, great for organizing  
**Cons:** Not as convenient as streaming directly in Stremio

<Callout type="note">
**The bottom line:** There are legitimate ways to use Stremio that respect copyright law. It requires more effort, but it's the only way to avoid legal and ethical issues.
</Callout>

## What If I've Already Installed Risky Add-ons?

Don't panic. Here's what to do:

1. **Uninstall the add-ons immediately** (see [How to Install & Remove Add-ons Safely](/addons/how-to-install-remove-addons-safely/))
2. **Clear your Stremio cache** (Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache)
3. **Run a malware scan** on your device
4. **Change your Stremio account password** if you think it might be compromised
5. **Going forward, only install trusted add-ons**

<Callout type="tip">
**You're in control.** Stremio makes it easy to remove add-ons. If you realize you've made a mistake, you can fix it in seconds.
</Callout>

## Teaching Others (Parents, Family, Friends)

If you're setting up Stremio for someone else, **have this conversation:**

- Explain that add-ons can be legal or illegal
- Set clear expectations about what they should and shouldn't install
- Show them how to check which add-ons are installed
- Teach them how to uninstall add-ons
- Make sure they understand the consequences

**For parents:** If you're setting up Stremio for kids, consider:

- Only installing curated, safe add-ons (YouTube Kids, educational content)
- Regularly checking installed add-ons
- Using parental controls at the network level (router, ISP)

---

## Common Myths Debunked

### Myth: "Using a VPN makes streaming legal"

**Reality:** A VPN hides your activity from your ISP, but it doesn't change the law. Streaming copyrighted content without authorization is still illegal, whether or not you're detected.

### Myth: "If the add-on is in Stremio's catalog, it must be legal"

**Reality:** Stremio allows third-party add-ons. The presence of an add-on in the catalog doesn't imply endorsement or legality.

### Myth: "I'm not downloading, so I'm safe"

**Reality:** Streaming is a form of temporary downloading. The legal distinction is minimal in most jurisdictions.

### Myth: "No one gets in trouble for streaming"

**Reality:** While prosecution of individual streamers is rare, it's increasing in some countries (especially in the EU). ISP warnings are common.
