## What is Metadata?

**Metadata** is *information about* a movie or TV show—everything except the actual video itself.

### What Metadata Includes

- **Posters** (vertical cover art)
- **Backdrops** (horizontal background images)
- **Titles** (official name)
- **Descriptions** (plot summaries)
- **Cast & Crew** (actors, directors, writers)
- **Release dates**
- **Genres** (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
- **Ratings** (IMDb scores, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.)
- **Runtime**
- **Episode lists** (for TV shows)
- **Season numbers**

<Callout type="note">
**Key point:** Metadata is separate from streams. A movie can have beautiful metadata but no streams (or vice versa).
</Callout>

## Why Metadata Matters

### 1. Aesthetic Appeal

Good metadata makes Stremio look polished:
- Professional posters instead of blank squares
- Accurate titles instead of file names
- Proper episode organization

### 2. Discoverability

Metadata helps you find content:
- Search by actor, director, or genre
- Browse by rating or release year
- Identify what you want to watch

### 3. Organization

Metadata keeps your library clean:
- TV shows grouped by season/episode
- Correct sorting (by title, date, etc.)
- No duplicates with different names

### 4. Context

Metadata gives you information to decide:
- Read plot summaries before committing
- Check ratings and reviews
- See cast and crew

## How Metadata Works in Stremio

### Metadata Add-ons

Stremio gets metadata from **metadata add-ons** (separate from stream add-ons).

**Default metadata add-on:**
- **Cinemeta** (Stremio's official metadata service)
- Pre-installed
- Provides metadata for most movies and TV shows

**Other metadata add-ons:**
- **TMDB** (The Movie Database)
- **AIOMetadata-style add-ons** (enhanced metadata with more sources)
- **Genre-specific add-ons** (anime, documentaries, etc.)

### How It Works

1. You search for or select a title in Stremio
2. Stremio asks **metadata add-ons**: "What info do you have for this title?"
3. Metadata add-ons return posters, descriptions, cast, etc.
4. Stremio displays the combined results

<Callout type="tip">
You can install multiple metadata add-ons. Stremio will use the first one that returns data for each field.
</Callout>

## Common Metadata Problems

### Problem: Wrong Poster or Backdrop

**Cause:**
- Metadata add-on pulled incorrect data
- Title has multiple versions (remakes, regional differences)
- Add-on's database is outdated

**Fix:** See [Fix Wrong Posters/Titles](/metadata/fix-wrong-posters-titles/)

---

### Problem: Missing Information

**Cause:**
- Metadata add-on doesn't have data for this title
- Title is very new or obscure
- Add-on is broken or offline

**Fix:**
- Install additional metadata add-ons
- Wait (data may be added later)
- Manually search for the title using a different spelling

---

### Problem: Duplicate Entries

**Cause:**
- Multiple metadata add-ons providing the same title
- Different spellings or regional variants

**Fix:**
- Uninstall redundant metadata add-ons
- Check your Library for duplicates and remove extras

---

### Problem: Wrong Language

**Cause:**
- Metadata add-on is set to a different language
- No metadata available in your preferred language

**Fix:** See [Language & Regional Settings](/metadata/language-and-regional-settings/)

---

## Metadata vs. Streams

**Metadata** and **streams** are provided by **different add-ons**.

| Aspect | Metadata Add-on | Stream Add-on |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Provides** | Info (posters, descriptions) | Playable video sources |
| **Examples** | Cinemeta, TMDB | YouTube, OpenSubtitles, etc. |
| **Legal status** | Always legal (just information) | Varies (depends on source) |
| **Required?** | Recommended (makes Stremio usable) | Required (to watch anything) |

**You need both types:**
- **Metadata add-ons** to see what's available and look pretty
- **Stream add-ons** to actually watch content

---

## Legal Metadata Use

Using metadata add-ons is **100% legal** everywhere. They're just pulling publicly available information from databases like IMDb, TMDB, etc.

**No legal risk** involved in:
- Installing metadata add-ons
- Browsing content via metadata
- Organizing your library with metadata

<Callout type="note">
Metadata add-ons don't provide streams, so they can't be used to access copyrighted content illegally. They're purely informational.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- **Install at least one metadata add-on** (Cinemeta is good for most users)
- **Try multiple metadata add-ons** if you're not satisfied with results
- **Keep metadata add-ons updated** (uninstall/reinstall if they seem stale)
- **Use metadata to track content** even if you watch elsewhere

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Install too many metadata add-ons** (can cause conflicts or duplicates)
- **Expect perfect metadata** for every title (some are obscure or new)
- **Confuse metadata with streams** (different purposes)
