A well-organized Stremio library makes it easier to find content, track your viewing progress, and enjoy a better streaming experience. This guide covers best practices for maintaining a clean library.

## Understanding Your Library

Your Stremio library consists of:

- **Library Tab**: Content you've added or started watching
- **Watchlist**: Content you plan to watch later
- **Continue Watching**: Partially watched content
- **History**: All content you've viewed

<Callout type="info">
Your library syncs across all devices when you're logged into your Stremio account. Changes on one device appear on all devices within minutes.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Watchlist Effectively

Add content you plan to watch later instead of adding everything to your library:

<Steps>

1. **Hover over content** and click the bookmark icon
2. **Add to Watchlist** instead of Library
3. **Move to Library** only when you start watching
4. **Remove from Watchlist** after watching

</Steps>

**Benefits:**
- Library stays focused on active content
- Easier to find what you're currently watching
- Watchlist acts as a "plan to watch" list

### 2. Remove Finished Content

Keep your library current by removing completed shows and movies:

<Steps>

1. **Open your Library** tab
2. **Right-click** (or long-press on mobile) on finished content
3. Select **"Remove from Library"**
4. Content stays in your history but leaves the main library

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
Removing from library doesn't delete your watch history or progress. You can always find previously watched content in the History section.
</Callout>

### 3. Manage Continue Watching

The "Continue Watching" section shows partially watched content:

**To keep it clean:**
- Finish or remove content you won't complete
- Right-click content and select "Remove from Library" if you're done
- Completed content automatically moves out after finishing

### 4. Handle Duplicates

Sometimes the same content appears multiple times due to different metadata sources:

**How to identify duplicates:**
- Same poster but different year
- Slightly different titles for the same content
- Multiple language versions

**How to fix:**
<Steps>

1. **Check IMDb IDs** to verify if they're actually different
2. **Remove the incorrect version** from your library
3. **Keep only the correct entry** (usually with the right year and IMDb ID)
4. See [Fix Wrong Posters/Titles](/metadata/fix-wrong-posters-titles/) for metadata issues

</Steps>

### 5. Organize by Categories

While Stremio doesn't have folders, you can organize using:

**Watchlist as Categories:**
- Use Trakt lists for different categories
- Create multiple Trakt lists (e.g., "Action Movies", "Comedies")
- Access via Trakt add-on integration

**Calendar for TV Shows:**
- Install calendar add-ons to track upcoming episodes
- View release schedules for shows in your library
- Plan your viewing accordingly
