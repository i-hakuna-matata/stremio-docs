## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before installing AIOMetadata, ensure you have:
- ✅ Active Stremio account (free at stremio.com)
- ✅ Stremio installed on your device (desktop, mobile, or TV)
- ✅ Internet connection
- ✅ Optional: RPDB API key (free, improves poster quality)

### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>

1. **Visit the AIOMetadata Configuration Page**
   - Go to: `https://viren070-stremio-addons.elfhosted.com/aiometadata/configure`
   - This is the official addon configuration page hosted by Viren070

2. **Configure Your Preferences**
   
   **RPDB Settings (Recommended)**:
   - Toggle "Enable RPDB" to ON
   - Get free API key at [ratingposterdb.com](https://ratingposterdb.com/)
   - Paste your API key in the field
   - Select poster style: "Standard" (with ratings) or "Clean" (minimal)
   
   **Language Options**:
   - Select your preferred metadata language (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
   - Choose whether to show original titles alongside translations
   
   **Rating Sources**:
   - Check which rating sources to display (IMDb, RT, Metacritic)
   - Configure rating display format (numbers vs. stars)
   
   **Advanced Options**:
   - Enable "Extended Metadata" for full cast/crew info
   - Toggle "Similar Titles" recommendations
   - Set cache duration (recommended: 24 hours)

3. **Generate Installation Link**
   - Click "Generate Link" button at bottom of page
   - A unique URL will be created with your settings encoded
   - Copy this entire URL to clipboard

4. **Install in Stremio**
   
   **Desktop/Web**:
   - Open Stremio
   - Click the puzzle piece icon (🧩) or go to Settings → Addons
   - Scroll down to "Install from URL" section
   - Paste your copied AIOMetadata URL
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for confirmation message (usually 2-5 seconds)
   
   **Mobile/TV**:
   - Method 1: Install on desktop first (syncs automatically)
   - Method 2: Use mobile browser to configure, then copy URL to Stremio app
   - Settings → Addons → Add Addon URL → Paste → Install

5. **Verify Installation**
   - Go to Settings → Addons → My Addons
   - You should see "AIOMetadata - Extended Metadata & RPDB" listed
   - Status indicator should show green/active
   - Check "Last Updated" timestamp is recent

6. **Set Metadata Priority (Important!)**
   
   To ensure AIOMetadata is your primary metadata source:
   - Go to Settings → Addons → My Addons
   - Find "Cinemeta" (default Stremio metadata)
   - Click "Uninstall" on Cinemeta
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Scroll down and click "Install" on Cinemeta again
   - This makes AIOMetadata the primary source (most recently installed wins)
   
   **Why this matters**: Stremio prioritizes the most recently installed metadata addon. Without this step, you'll still see default posters instead of RPDB artwork.

7. **Test the Installation**
   - Search for a popular movie (e.g., "Oppenheimer", "Dune", "Barbie")
   - The poster should now display:
     - High-resolution RPDB artwork
     - Rating badges in top corner
     - Sharper, more vibrant colors
   - Click on the title to see extended metadata
   - Verify cast photos load quickly

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**First-Time Setup Tip**: After installation, force-refresh your Stremio app (Ctrl+Shift+R on desktop, or force-close and reopen on mobile) to ensure all posters reload with RPDB artwork.

---

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Poster Style Preferences

AIOMetadata supports multiple RPDB poster styles:

**Standard (Recommended)**:
- Ratings overlayed on poster
- IMDb + RT + Metacritic badges
- Most popular choice among users
- Best for quick quality assessment

**Clean/Minimal**:
- No rating badges
- Pure artwork focus
- Preferred by design purists
- Better for screenshots/sharing

**Textless**:
- No title text on poster
- Clean aesthetic
- Great for international content
- May make browsing harder

**Reddit Recommendation**:
> "I use Standard style 90% of the time, but switch to Textless when taking screenshots to share on social media. Looks way more professional." - u/screenshot_king (r/StremioAddons)

### Language & Localization

Configure language preferences for optimal experience:

**Single Language Mode**:
- Set one primary language (e.g., English)
- All metadata in that language
- Simplest option for monolingual users

**Dual Language Mode**:
- Primary language + original title
- Great for international films
- Example: "Parasite (기생충)" shows both English and Korean

**Multi-Language Fallback**:
- Primary → Secondary → English fallback
- Useful for less common languages
- Ensures you always get some metadata

**Reddit Pro Tip**:
> "If you watch a lot of anime or foreign films, enable 'Show Original Title' in settings. It helps you search correctly and avoid dub/sub confusion." - u/subtitle_master (r/anime)


### Rating Display Configuration

Customize how ratings appear on your posters:

**All Ratings (Default)**:
- Shows IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic
- Takes most poster space
- Complete at-a-glance quality assessment

**IMDb Only**:
- Minimal, clean look
- Most universally trusted rating
- Recommended for bandwidth-limited users

**Custom Combination**:
- Pick 2 of 3 rating sources
- Example: IMDb + RT (skip Metacritic)
- Balance between info and aesthetics

**Reddit Discussion**:
> "I only show IMDb ratings because RT scores are often inflated for certain genres. IMDb user scores feel more reliable to me." - u/rating_skeptic (r/movies)

> "I use all three. If all three ratings are high, I know it's gold. If they disagree, I read reviews first." - u/careful_chooser (r/TrueFilm)

### Cache & Performance Settings

**Cache Duration Options**:

- **6 Hours**: For very active users, ensures latest posters
- **24 Hours (Recommended)**: Balance of freshness and performance
- **7 Days**: For bandwidth-limited or slow connections
- **30 Days**: Only for users who rarely discover new content

**Poster Quality Settings**:

- **Ultra HD (4K)**: Best quality, larger downloads (~2-5 MB per poster)
- **High (1080p)**: Recommended for most users, great balance
- **Medium (720p)**: Faster loading on slow connections
- **Low (480p)**: Only for very limited bandwidth

**Reddit Performance Tips**:
> "I set cache to 7 days and poster quality to High. Posters load instantly after first view, and they still look amazing on my 4K TV." - u/performance_optimizer (r/StremioAddons)

> "If you're on mobile data or slow internet, use 720p posters. The difference is barely noticeable on phone screens anyway." - u/mobile_user_pro (r/Stremio)

## Reddit User Experiences & Tips

### Real User Success Stories

**From u/longtime_lurker123** (r/StremioAddons):
> "I've been running AIOMetadata for 6 months straight. Zero issues. The RPDB posters make my Stremio look like a $20/month premium service. My wife actually prefers our Stremio to our Netflix subscription now."

**From u/4k_theater_setup** (r/StremioAddons4K):
> "Showing off my home theater with Stremio + AIOMetadata to guests is always fun. They see the gorgeous 4K posters with ratings and think I spent thousands on some custom HTPC setup. Nope, just free Stremio with the right addons."

**From u/anime_fan_forever** (r/anime):
> "AIOMetadata changed how I watch anime on Stremio. The RPDB anime posters are so much better than default ones. Plus seeing MAL scores right on the poster helps me decide what to watch next."

### Community Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Combine with Trakt for Ultimate Experience**
> "Use AIOMetadata for gorgeous visuals + Trakt for watch tracking. Your Stremio will look AND function better than any streaming service." - u/optimization_guru

**Tip 2: Periodic Refresh for New Posters**
> "Once a month, I clear Stremio cache (Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache) to pull fresh RPDB posters. New artwork gets added all the time." - u/poster_collector

**Tip 3: Different Configs for Different Devices**
> "I use 4K posters on my desktop/TV but 720p posters on my phone. Save bandwidth on mobile while keeping quality on big screen." - u/multi_device_master

**Tip 4: Check RPDB Before Watching**
> "When I'm unsure about a movie, I look at the RPDB poster in Stremio. If it has a nice custom poster, someone cared enough to make it, usually means it's worth watching." - u/poster_quality_theory

**Tip 5: Use for Discovery**
> "I browse my Stremio library just to look at the beautiful RPDB posters. I've discovered so many great movies I would've scrolled past with default artwork." - u/visual_browser

### Common Questions from Reddit

**Q: "Does AIOMetadata work on Android TV?"**
> "Yes, perfectly. Install on your phone/desktop first, it syncs automatically to your TV. The posters look INSANE on a 55+ inch screen." - u/android_tv_user (r/AndroidTV)

**Q: "Will this slow down Stremio?"**
> "Opposite actually. After initial cache, AIOMetadata loads faster than default Cinemeta because of better optimization." - u/performance_tester (r/StremioAddons)

**Q: "Can I use AIOMetadata without RPDB API key?"**
> "Yes, but you're missing out on 80% of the addon's value. The API key is free and takes 2 minutes to get. Absolutely worth it." - u/helpful_redditor

**Q: "Does this work with Torrentio/other streaming addons?"**
> "100% compatible. AIOMetadata only handles visuals/info, doesn't interfere with streaming addons at all. I use it with Torrentio + RD." - u/addon_expert

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Posters Not Updating

**Symptoms**:
- Still seeing default/low-quality posters after installation
- RPDB ratings not appearing

**Solutions**:

<Steps>

1. **Force Priority Reset**
   - Uninstall ALL metadata addons (including Cinemeta)
   - Close Stremio completely (force quit on mobile)
   - Reopen Stremio
   - Reinstall AIOMetadata first
   - Then reinstall Cinemeta
   
2. **Clear Cache**
   - Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache
   - Sign out and sign back in
   - Force close and reopen app
   - Browse to a few titles to trigger reload

3. **Verify API Key**
   - Go to RPDB website and confirm key is active
   - Check if key has hit rate limit (1000/day free tier)
   - Try regenerating a new API key
   - Reconfigure AIOMetadata with new key

4. **Check Network**
   - Ensure you can access ratingposterdb.com
   - Some ISPs/countries block certain CDNs
   - Try using VPN if posters won't load
   - Check if firewall is blocking RPDB domains

</Steps>

**Reddit Solution**:
> "If posters still don't update, uninstall EVERYTHING, clear cache, restart Stremio, then install ONLY AIOMetadata. Wait 5 minutes, then add back your streaming addons. This nuclear option has never failed me." - u/troubleshooting_master (r/StremioAddons)

### Slow Loading or Timeouts

**Symptoms**:
- Posters take 10+ seconds to load
- "Loading metadata" message appears frequently
- App feels sluggish

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce Poster Quality**:
   - Change from Ultra HD to High (1080p)
   - Reduces file size by 60% with minimal visual difference

2. **Increase Cache Duration**:
   - Set cache to 7 or 30 days
   - Reduces API calls significantly

3. **Check RPDB Status**:
   - Visit [status.ratingposterdb.com](https://status.ratingposterdb.com)
   - If RPDB is down, addon falls back to TMDB (slower)
   - Wait for service to restore

4. **Server Region Selection**:
   - Some AIOMetadata configs let you choose CDN region
   - Pick closest geographic region to you
   - Example: US East, EU West, Asia Pacific

**Performance Tip from Reddit**:
> "I was getting 15-second load times until I switched from Ultra HD to High posters. Now everything loads in 2-3 seconds. Can't tell the difference on my 1080p TV anyway." - u/fixed_my_lag (r/StremioAddons)


### Wrong Metadata or Posters

**Symptoms**:
- Movie poster shows wrong film
- TV show episodes have incorrect info
- Ratings seem off

**Solutions**:

1. **TMDB Matching Issue**:
   - Problem is usually with TMDB database, not AIOMetadata
   - Visit [themoviedb.org](https://themoviedb.org)
   - Search for the title
   - Report incorrect information to TMDB
   - Wait 24-48 hours for sync

2. **Multiple Versions**:
   - Some movies have multiple TMDB entries (2024 vs 2024 remake)
   - Try searching with year: "Movie Title 2024"
   - Or search with IMDb ID directly

3. **RPDB Poster Override**:
   - RPDB sometimes has wrong poster tagged
   - Report to RPDB community
   - Or disable RPDB temporarily for that specific title

4. **Force Metadata Refresh**:
   - Clear cache
   - Search for title again
   - Click into details page to trigger fresh API call

**Community Insight**:
> "95% of wrong poster issues are TMDB's fault, not AIOMetadata. Report bad data to TMDB, and most get fixed within a week." - u/metadata_veteran (r/StremioAddons)

### API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**:
- Posters randomly stop loading
- Error messages about "too many requests"
- Default posters appear intermittently

**Solutions**:

1. **Check RPDB API Limit**:
   - Free tier: 1000 requests/day
   - Log into RPDB account
   - Check "API Usage" dashboard
   - If maxed out, wait for daily reset (midnight UTC)

2. **Optimize Cache Settings**:
   - Increase cache duration to 7+ days
   - Reduces daily API calls dramatically
   - Browse less frantically (each poster = 1 request)

3. **Consider RPDB Pro**:
   - $5/month for unlimited API calls
   - Supports RPDB development
   - Worth it if you browse 1000+ posters/day

4. **Use Multiple API Keys**:
   - Create second RPDB account (different email)
   - Use alternate key on second device
   - Both sync to same Stremio account

**Heavy User Strategy**:
> "I browse A LOT. Hit the 1000/day limit regularly. Got RPDB Pro for $5/month. Best $5 I spend every month, honestly." - u/binge_browser (r/StremioAddons)

## Comparing AIOMetadata to Alternatives

### AIOMetadata vs Default Cinemeta

| Feature | AIOMetadata | Cinemeta |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Poster Quality | RPDB 4K artwork | Basic TMDB posters |
| Load Speed | Faster (optimized) | Standard |
| Rating Display | IMDb + RT + Meta | IMDb only |
| Extended Info | Full cast/crew/budget | Basic info |
| Customization | Highly configurable | Fixed |
| Maintenance | Active community | Official but basic |

**Reddit Verdict**:
> "Cinemeta is fine if you just want basics. But if you care AT ALL about how your library looks, AIOMetadata is non-negotiable." - u/ui_matters (r/StremioAddons)

### AIOMetadata vs Separate RPDB Addon

| Feature | AIOMetadata | Standalone RPDB |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Setup Complexity | One addon | Need both RPDB + metadata |
| Feature Integration | Seamless | Manual configuration |
| Performance | Optimized | Can conflict |
| Maintenance | Single update | Update both separately |
| Flexibility | All-in-one | More granular control |

**Reddit Recommendation**:
> "I used to run separate RPDB + TMDB addons. AIOMetadata combines both perfectly. Switched over and never looked back. One less thing to manage." - u/simplify_life (r/Stremio)

### AIOMetadata vs ThePosterDB (TPDB)

| Feature | AIOMetadata (RPDB) | TPDB Addon |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Poster Collection | 800K+ posters | 1M+ posters |
| Rating Overlays | Yes (built-in) | Manual config |
| Update Frequency | Daily | Weekly |
| Community Size | Large, active | Larger, less active |
| API Limits | 1K/day free | 5K/day free |

**When to Choose TPDB Instead**:
- You want textless posters exclusively
- You need language-specific poster variants
- You browse 1K+ posters/day and don't want to pay

**Reddit Opinion**:
> "RPDB (via AIOMetadata) has better rating overlays. TPDB has more poster variety. I use both - RPDB for 90%, TPDB for obscure indie films." - u/poster_connoisseur (r/PlexPosters)

---

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### Optimal Setup for Most Users

**Recommended Configuration**:
1. ✅ Enable RPDB with free API key
2. ✅ Set poster quality to "High" (1080p)
3. ✅ Cache duration: 24 hours
4. ✅ Show all three rating sources
5. ✅ Enable extended metadata
6. ✅ Match Stremio interface language
7. ✅ Install AIOMetadata LAST (for priority)

**Why This Works**:
> "This is my exact setup for 8 months. Perfect balance of quality, speed, and features. Never had a single issue." - u/optimal_config (r/StremioAddons)

### For 4K/Large Screen Users

**Enhanced Configuration**:
- Poster quality: Ultra HD (4K)
- Cache: 7 days (4K posters are larger)
- Extended metadata: ON
- Similar titles: ON (better browsing)

**Reddit Setup**:
> "On my 75-inch 4K TV, Ultra HD posters are absolutely necessary. Regular HD looks blurry. The file size is worth it." - u/home_theater_buff (r/4KMovies)


### For Mobile/Bandwidth-Limited Users

**Optimized Configuration**:
- Poster quality: Medium (720p)
- Cache: 30 days
- Rating sources: IMDb only
- Extended metadata: OFF (faster)

**Mobile User Feedback**:
> "I'm on mobile data 90% of the time. Using 720p posters and long cache, AIOMetadata barely uses any data. Still looks way better than default." - u/mobile_data_saver (r/StremioAddons)

### For Anime/International Content Fans

**Specialized Configuration**:
- Language: Match your preference (Japanese, Korean, etc.)
- Show original titles: ON
- RPDB style: Textless (anime posters are artistic)
- Extended metadata: ON (get Japanese cast/crew)

**Anime Community Input**:
> "AIOMetadata makes Stremio the best anime platform. RPDB has gorgeous anime posters, way better than Crunchyroll or MAL integration." - u/anime_aesthetics (r/anime)

---

## Integration with Other Addons

### Perfect Addon Stack (Reddit Recommended)

**The "Holy Trinity" Setup**:
1. **AIOMetadata** - Visuals & information
2. **Torrentio** - Streaming sources
3. **Trakt** - Watch tracking

**Why This Combination Works**:
> "These three addons transform Stremio into something that genuinely feels better than Netflix, Disney+, or any paid service. AIOMetadata makes it look premium, Torrentio makes it work perfectly, and Trakt makes it smart." - u/trinity_believer (r/StremioAddons)

### With Debrid Services

**AIOMetadata + Real-Debrid/AllDebrid**:
- AIOMetadata: Metadata & visuals
- Torrentio configured with RD/AD: Instant 4K streams
- Result: Premium quality content + premium interface

**Community Experience**:
> "I pay $4/month for Real-Debrid. Between that and AIOMetadata (free!), my Stremio setup absolutely destroys $200/month worth of streaming subscriptions." - u/cord_cutter_2024 (r/cordcutters)

### With Subtitle Addons

**AIOMetadata + OpenSubtitles/Addic7ed**:
- Works seamlessly together
- AIOMetadata shows subtitle availability in metadata
- No conflicts or performance issues

**Accessibility User**:
> "I rely on subtitles 100%. AIOMetadata + OpenSubtitles is perfect. I can see subtitle availability before clicking, saves so much time." - u/subtitle_dependent (r/accessibility)

## Frequently Asked Questions (from Reddit)

### General Questions

**Q: Is AIOMetadata safe to use?**
> "100% safe. It only requests metadata permissions, never asks for streams or your password. Developer u/viren070 is well-known and trusted in the community." - u/security_conscious (r/StremioAddons)

**Q: Will this break my existing setup?**
> "No. Metadata addons don't interfere with streaming addons. I added AIOMetadata to my existing setup and everything worked instantly." - u/worried_user (r/Stremio)

**Q: Does this cost money?**
> "AIOMetadata is 100% free. RPDB API key is also free (1000 requests/day). You can optionally pay for RPDB Pro ($5/month) for unlimited, but not required." - u/budget_streamer

**Q: How often does it update?**
> "RPDB database updates daily. AIOMetadata pulls new posters based on your cache settings (default 24 hours). So you get new artwork constantly." - u/always_fresh

### Technical Questions

**Q: Does it work offline?**
> "Cached metadata works offline. But you need internet initially to download posters. After that, cached content loads offline." - u/offline_watcher

**Q: Will it slow down my Stremio?**
> "Opposite! AIOMetadata is faster than default Cinemeta because of optimized code. Most users report speed improvements." - u/performance_nut

**Q: Can I use multiple metadata addons?**

**Q: Does it work on all devices?**
> "Yes! Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux), Android, Android TV, iOS (via web), Fire TV Stick. Syncs across all devices via your Stremio account." - u/multi_platform_user

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why aren't posters showing?**
> "99% of the time it's a priority issue. Uninstall and reinstall AIOMetadata AFTER Cinemeta to make it primary. Then clear cache and restart." - u/troubleshooter_pro

**Q: Why are some posters still default quality?**
> "Not all content has RPDB posters (yet). Community is constantly adding more. Obscure/old content might default to TMDB posters temporarily." - u/realistic_expectations

**Q: How do I know if AIOMetadata is working?**
> "Search for a popular movie like 'Dune' or 'Oppenheimer'. If you see rating badges in the corner and ultra-sharp poster art, it's working." - u/verification_helper

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Maximize Speed

1. **Set Longer Cache** (7-30 days):
   - Reduces API calls
   - Faster subsequent loads
   - Minimal downside (posters rarely change)

2. **Choose Appropriate Poster Quality**:
   - Desktop/TV: High or Ultra HD
   - Tablet: High
   - Phone: Medium
   - Slow connection: Medium or Low

3. **Disable Extended Metadata** (if not needed):
   - Saves ~30% API response time
   - Only disable if you don't read cast/crew info

4. **Pre-cache Popular Content**:
   - Browse your library once after installing
   - Let all posters load and cache
   - Future browsing will be instant

**Speed Demon Setup**:
> "I optimized every setting for speed: 30-day cache, High quality (not Ultra), extended metadata OFF. My Stremio loads posters INSTANTLY. Feels like a native app." - u/speed_optimizer (r/StremioAddons)

### Minimize Bandwidth Usage

1. **Lower Poster Quality**: Medium or Low
2. **Longer Cache**: 30 days
3. **Disable Auto-Refresh**: Prevents background updates
4. **Limit Rating Sources**: IMDb only (fewer overlay images)

**Data Saver Success**:
> "I'm on a metered connection (4GB/month). Using Medium posters and 30-day cache, AIOMetadata uses maybe 50MB per month total. Worth every byte." - u/limited_data_user (r/StremioAddons)

## Migration Guide

### Moving from Default Cinemeta

<Steps>

1. **Install AIOMetadata** (follow installation guide above)
2. **Verify it works** (check a few posters)
3. **Keep Cinemeta as backup** (don't uninstall unless having conflicts)
4. **Clear cache once** to force RPDB poster download
5. **Browse and enjoy** upgraded visuals

</Steps>

**Migration Experience**:
> "Switched from default Cinemeta to AIOMetadata in 5 minutes. The difference is night and day. Can't believe I waited this long." - u/late_adopter (r/Stremio)

### Moving from Other Metadata Addons

**From Standalone RPDB Addon**:
- Uninstall old RPDB addon first
- Install AIOMetadata
- Reconfigure with your RPDB API key
- Result: Same visuals, better performance

**From TPDB Addon**:
- Can keep both installed
- AIOMetadata as primary (install last)
- TPDB as fallback for missing posters
- Best of both worlds

**From Trakt Only**:
- Keep Trakt installed (different purpose)
- Add AIOMetadata for visuals
- They complement each other perfectly
