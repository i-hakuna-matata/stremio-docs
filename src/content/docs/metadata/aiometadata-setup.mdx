Metadata add-ons enhance Stremio by providing detailed information about movies, TV shows, and other content. This guide will help you install and configure metadata add-ons to get the best viewing experience.

## What are Metadata Add-ons?

Metadata add-ons provide:
- **Posters & Artwork**: High-quality images for content
- **Descriptions**: Plot summaries and synopses
- **Cast & Crew**: Actor and director information
- **Ratings**: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and other ratings
- **Release Dates**: Air dates and premiere information
- **Episode Information**: Season/episode numbers and titles

<Callout type="info">
Most users don't need additional metadata add-ons as Stremio comes with Cinemeta built-in, which provides excellent metadata from The Movie Database (TMDb) and other sources.
</Callout>

## Built-in Metadata: Cinemeta

Stremio includes **Cinemeta** by default, which provides comprehensive metadata for:
- Movies
- TV series
- Anime
- Documentaries

Cinemeta is maintained by the Stremio team and automatically updates with the latest content information.

## Installing Additional Metadata Add-ons

<Steps>

1. **Open the Add-ons Page**
   - Click the puzzle piece icon in the top navigation
   - Or go to Settings → Add-ons

2. **Browse Community Add-ons**
   - Scroll through the catalog or use the search function
   - Look for add-ons labeled "Metadata" or "Catalog"

3. **Install a Metadata Add-on**
   - Click on the add-on you want to install
   - Click "Install" to add it to your account
   - The add-on will sync across all your devices

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Go to Settings → Add-ons
   - Check that the new add-on appears in your installed list

</Steps>

## Example: Install the AIOMetadata Add-on

Although the steps above work for any metadata source, here's how a typical **AIOMetadata-style** add-on installation looks in practice:

<Steps>

1. **Find the add-on**
   - Open **Add-ons → Community**
   - Search for **"AIOMetadata"**, **"AIO Meta"**, or the specific URL provided by a trusted developer such as Viren070
   - If it's hosted externally, click **"Install via link"** and paste the add-on URL

2. **Review permissions**
   - Confirm it only lists **catalog** and **meta** capabilities
   - Legitimate metadata add-ons never request stream/torrent permissions or your Stremio password

3. **Install**
   - Click **Install**
   - A confirmation toast should appear within a few seconds

4. **Set priority**
   - Go to **Add-ons → Installed**
   - Temporarily uninstall/reinstall metadata add-ons so the AIOMetadata entry becomes the most recently installed (and therefore primary) source

5. **Test**
   - Search for a newly released title or anime
   - Confirm that posters, cast, and rating badges match what the add-on claims to provide

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
If an add-on named "AIOMetadata" also advertises premium streams or asks for login credentials, uninstall it immediately and report it via [Reporting Issues & Scams](/privacy-security/reporting-issues-and-scams/).
</Callout>

## Configuring Metadata Priority

Stremio uses metadata from installed add-ons in a specific order:

1. **Installation Order**: Later installed add-ons take priority
2. **Built-in Priority**: Cinemeta has baseline priority
3. **Fallback System**: If one source fails, Stremio tries the next

<Callout type="tip">
To change priority, uninstall and reinstall add-ons in your preferred order. The most recently installed add-on will have the highest priority.
</Callout>

### View Raw Responses (Advanced)

Need to know exactly which add-on is providing a field? Open **Developer Tools** (Ctrl+Shift+I on desktop), go to the **Network** tab, and filter requests containing `/metainfo`. Each response lists the add-on identifier, making it easier to debug mismatched posters or ratings.

## Language & Regional Settings

Configure metadata language preferences:

<Steps>

1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Select your preferred **Interface Language**
3. Some metadata add-ons will automatically match this language
4. For content-specific languages, check individual add-on settings

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Metadata Issues

### Missing Posters or Information

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes and refresh the page
- Try searching for the content again
- Check if your metadata add-ons are working
- Verify your internet connection

### Wrong Metadata

**Solutions:**
- The content might be incorrectly matched
- Try using a different metadata add-on
- Report issues to the add-on developer
- See [Fix Wrong Posters/Titles](/metadata/fix-wrong-posters-titles/) for detailed steps

### Metadata Not Loading

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Disable and re-enable the metadata add-on
- Clear Stremio's cache (Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache)
- Reinstall the problematic add-on

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Keep Cinemeta enabled as your primary source
- Install metadata add-ons from trusted sources
- Test add-ons with a few titles before relying on them
- Report issues to add-on developers

❌ **Don't:**
- Install too many metadata add-ons (can cause conflicts)
- Remove Cinemeta unless you have a reliable alternative
- Share your Trakt API keys or credentials
- Install add-ons from suspicious sources

---

## Metadata Maintenance Checklist

Run this quick audit every few weeks (or whenever artwork looks wrong):

1. **Refresh catalogs:** Reload the Discover page (Ctrl/Cmd + R on desktop) to force new posters to download.
2. **Check a new release:** Search for a movie/show released this month. Missing artwork usually means your primary metadata source is down.
3. **Clear cache if thumbnails stay blurry:** Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache, then sign back in.
4. **Remove stale add-ons:** Fewer metadata providers = fewer conflicts.
5. **Update API tokens:** If RPDB/Trakt revoke keys, re-authenticate from the add-on settings screen.

Keep short notes/screenshots when you notice issues—developers appreciate detailed bug reports.

## Advanced: Custom Metadata Add-ons

For developers or advanced users, you can create custom metadata add-ons:

1. **Use the Stremio Add-on SDK**: [github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk)
2. **Follow the documentation**: [stremio.github.io/stremio-addon-sdk](https://stremio.github.io/stremio-addon-sdk/)
3. **Test locally** before publishing
4. **Share with the community** on the Stremio subreddit or Discord
