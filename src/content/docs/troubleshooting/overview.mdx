## When to Reinstall

Reinstalling should be a **last resort**, but it's necessary if:

- Stremio won't launch at all after trying everything
- Corruption is suspected (frequent crashes, data loss)
- You've exhausted all other troubleshooting steps

### How to Reinstall Cleanly

1. **Uninstall Stremio** (see your device-specific install guide)
2. **Delete user data folder:**
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Stremio`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Stremio`
   - **Linux:** `~/.config/Stremio`
   - **Android:** Clear app data in Settings → Apps → Stremio
3. **Restart your device**
4. **Download fresh installer** from [stremio.com](https://www.stremio.com)
5. **Install** and set up from scratch

<Callout type="warning">
**Warning:** Deleting user data erases local settings and cache. Your library is safe if you have a Stremio account (cloud-synced).
