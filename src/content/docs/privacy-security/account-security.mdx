Protecting your Stremio account is essential for maintaining privacy and preventing unauthorized access. This guide covers security best practices for your Stremio account.

## Why Account Security Matters

Your Stremio account stores:
- **Watch history**: What you've watched and when
- **Library data**: Your saved content and watchlist
- **Add-on configurations**: Installed add-ons and settings
- **Preferences**: App settings and customizations
- **Sync data**: Information synced across devices

<Callout type="warning">
While Stremio itself is secure, using weak passwords or sharing credentials can compromise your privacy and viewing data.
</Callout>

## Creating a Strong Password

### Password Requirements

Stremio requires a password, but stronger is always better:

**Recommended:**
- **12+ characters** minimum
- **Mix of uppercase and lowercase** letters
- **Include numbers** and special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- **Avoid common words** or personal information
- **Unique password** not used elsewhere

<Callout type="tip">
Use a **password manager** like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass to generate and store strong passwords securely.
</Callout>

## Changing Your Password

<Steps>

1. **Log into Stremio** on any device
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Select **Account** from the sidebar
4. Click **Change Password**
5. **Enter current password**
6. **Enter new strong password**
7. **Confirm new password**
8. Click **Save Changes**

</Steps>

## Email Security

Your email is the recovery method for your Stremio account:

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Use a **secure email provider** (Gmail, ProtonMail, Outlook)
- Enable **two-factor authentication** on your email
- Use a **strong unique password** for email
- **Verify** email address with Stremio
- Keep email **up to date**

❌ **Don't:**
- Use disposable or temporary email addresses
- Share email credentials
- Use same password for email and Stremio
- Ignore password reset emails you didn't request

## Account Privacy Settings

### What Stremio Tracks

Stremio collects minimal data:
- **Account email**: For login and recovery
- **Watch history**: To sync across devices
- **Add-on list**: To restore on other devices
- **App settings**: To maintain consistency

**Stremio does NOT:**
- Monitor what specific content you watch
- Share your viewing habits with third parties
- Track your location beyond basic analytics
- Store payment information (no paid subscriptions)

## Protecting Your Account

### Secure Your Devices

Your Stremio account is only as secure as your devices:

**Device Security Checklist:**
- Use **device lock screens** (PIN, password, biometric)
- Keep **operating systems updated**
- Install **antivirus/anti-malware** on computers
- Avoid **public or shared devices** for logging in
- Use **trusted networks** (avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations)

### Add-on Security

Be cautious with add-on permissions:

<Callout type="warning">
Some add-ons may require personal information or API keys. Only provide credentials to **trusted add-ons** from reputable developers.
</Callout>

**Safe Practices:**
- Only install add-ons from the **official catalog** or verified sources
- Read **reviews and ratings** before installing
- Check the **developer's reputation**
- Avoid add-ons requesting **unnecessary permissions**
