## What Stremio Itself Collects

### With a Stremio Account

If you create a free Stremio account, Stremio stores:

- ✅ **Your email address**
- ✅ **Your library** (watchlist, viewing progress)
- ✅ **Your installed add-ons** (list, not your activity with them)
- ✅ **Settings** (language, player preferences, etc.)

**Where it's stored:**  
Stremio's cloud servers (for syncing across devices)

**Who can access it:**  
Only you (via your login) and Stremio's servers

**What Stremio does NOT collect:**
- ❌ What you watch via add-ons
- ❌ Your IP address (beyond login authentication)
- ❌ Your streaming activity
- ❌ Payment info (Stremio is free, no payments)

### Without a Stremio Account

If you use Stremio without an account:

- All data stays **local on your device**
- Nothing is sent to Stremio's servers
- No cloud sync

---

## What Add-ons Can See

This is the **most important privacy concern**.

### What Add-ons Collect

When you use an add-on, the add-on's server can log:

- ✅ **Your IP address** (reveals your location and ISP)
- ✅ **What you search for**
- ✅ **What you click on** (titles, streams)
- ✅ **When you access content**
- ✅ **Your device info** (OS, browser, Stremio version)
- ✅ **Your viewing patterns** (what, when, how often)

**You have no control over:**
- What data they collect
- How long they keep it
- Who they share it with
- Whether they sell it to third parties

<Callout type="warning">
**Installing an add-on means trusting the developer with your activity data.** This is why choosing add-ons carefully is critical.
</Callout>

### Torrent-Based Add-ons (Extra Risk)

If an add-on uses **torrents** (BitTorrent), additional privacy issues arise:

- ✅ **Your IP is visible** to everyone in the torrent swarm (hundreds/thousands of people)
- ✅ **Copyright holders monitor torrent swarms** and log IPs
- ✅ **Your ISP can see** you're using BitTorrent (even if not what specifically)
- ✅ **Your upload activity** is tracked (torrenting requires uploading, which is distribution—more legally risky than just downloading)

**Bottom line:** Torrent-based add-ons are the **highest privacy risk**.

---

## What Your ISP Can See

Your **Internet Service Provider** (Comcast, Verizon, BT, etc.) can see:

- ✅ **That you're using Stremio** (they can see the app's network traffic)
- ✅ **IP addresses you connect to** (servers for add-ons, streams, etc.)
- ✅ **Amount of data transferred** (streaming uses lots of bandwidth)
- ✅ **If you're using torrents** (BitTorrent has a distinctive pattern)

**What they can't see (usually):**
- ❌ Specific titles you watch (if connections are HTTPS)
- ❌ Content of encrypted streams

### ISP Actions

If your ISP detects illegal activity (e.g., torrenting copyrighted content):

- **Warning letter** (DMCA notice in the US, equivalent elsewhere)
- **Throttling** (slowing your connection)
- **Service suspension** (temporary or permanent)
- **Legal action** (rare for individuals, common for distributors)

---

## How to Protect Your Privacy

### 1. Choose Add-ons Carefully

**The single most important step.**

- ✅ Only install add-ons from **trusted, reputable sources**
- ✅ Prefer **open-source add-ons** (code can be audited)
- ✅ Avoid add-ons with no clear developer or privacy policy
- ✅ Regularly **audit and remove** add-ons you don't use

See [How to Evaluate Add-on Trust](/addons/how-to-evaluate-addon-trust/) and [Avoiding Suspicious Add-ons](/privacy-security/avoiding-suspicious-addons/).

---

### 2. Use HTTPS Add-ons

**HTTPS** encrypts data between you and the add-on server.

- **Protects from:** Your ISP seeing what specific content you request
- **Doesn't protect from:** The add-on itself logging your activity

**How to check:**
- Add-on URLs starting with `https://` are secure
- URLs starting with `http://` are NOT secure (avoid these)

---

### 3. Consider a VPN

A **Virtual Private Network** (VPN) encrypts all your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another location.

**What a VPN does:**
- ✅ **Hides your IP address** from add-ons and torrent swarms
- ✅ **Encrypts all traffic** so your ISP can't see what you're doing
- ✅ **Bypasses geo-restrictions** (access content blocked in your region)

**What a VPN does NOT do:**
- ❌ **Make illegal activity legal** (you're still breaking the law, just hiding it)
- ❌ **Guarantee privacy** (VPN provider can log your activity—choose wisely)
- ❌ **Prevent malware** (separate issue)

<Callout type="legal">
**Legal note:** Using a VPN is legal in most countries (exceptions: China, Russia, UAE, etc.). However, using a VPN to evade copyright law is still illegal—you're just less likely to be caught.
</Callout>

#### Choosing a VPN

**Good VPNs:**
- **No-logs policy** (doesn't record your activity)
- **Paid** (free VPNs often log and sell your data)
- **Reputable** (ProtonVPN, Mullvad, IVPN, etc.—do your research)
- **Fast** (VPNs can slow your connection—choose one with good speeds)

**Bad VPNs:**
- **Free** (if you're not paying, you're the product)
- **Logs activity** (defeats the purpose)
- **Slow** (makes streaming unusable)

**How to use with Stremio:**
- Install VPN software on your device
- Connect to a VPN server
- Then open Stremio and use normally

---

### 4. Use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)

Your ISP can see your DNS queries (what websites you visit) unless you encrypt them.

**DNS-over-HTTPS** encrypts DNS requests.

**How to enable:**
- **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy → DNS over HTTPS (on by default)
- **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy → Security → Use secure DNS
- **System-wide:** Configure your OS or router (varies by device)

**Benefit:** Your ISP can't see what domains you're querying (including add-on servers).

---

### 5. Avoid Torrent-Based Add-ons

The safest approach is to **not use torrent-based add-ons** at all.

- Use **HTTP/HLS-based add-ons** instead (legal ones, ideally)
- If you must use torrents, **always use a VPN** (still risky, but reduces IP exposure)

---

### 6. Regularly Clear Cache & Data

Stremio stores temporary data (cache) on your device.

**What to clear:**
- Go to **Settings** → **Advanced** → **Clear Cache**

**When:**
- Once a month (if you use Stremio frequently)
- After uninstalling risky add-ons
- If you're concerned about local data exposure

**What it clears:**
- Posters, metadata cache
- Temporary stream data
- **Does NOT clear:** Your library (if you have an account)

---

### 7. Use Private Browsing (Web Version)

If using Stremio on the web (app.strem.io):

- Use **Incognito/Private mode** in your browser
- This prevents local cookies and history from being saved
- **Doesn't hide activity from your ISP** (still need a VPN for that)

---

## Privacy Threat Models

Different users have different privacy needs. Assess your situation:

### Low Threat Model

**Who you are:**
- Using Stremio for legal content only (YouTube, podcasts, etc.)
- No concerns about surveillance

**What you need:**
- Basic hygiene (don't install sketchy add-ons)
- Use HTTPS add-ons
- That's it—you're fine

---

### Medium Threat Model

**Who you are:**
- Using some gray-area add-ons (debrid services for personal content, geo-unlocking, etc.)
- Want to keep ISP from seeing your activity

**What you need:**
- All "Low" measures, plus:
- **VPN** (trusted, no-logs)
- **DNS-over-HTTPS**
- **Regularly audit add-ons**

---

### High Threat Model

**Who you are:**
- Concerned about government surveillance, ISP logging, or legal action
- Living in a jurisdiction with strict copyright enforcement or internet monitoring

**What you need:**
- All "Medium" measures, plus:
- **Use Stremio only with legal add-ons**, or
- **Don't use Stremio for sensitive activity** (use a separate, airgapped device if needed)
- **Tor** instead of VPN (advanced, slower, but better anonymity)
- **Avoid torrents entirely** (too high-risk)

<Callout type="note">
**Realistic advice:** If you're in a "High" threat model, you probably shouldn't be using streaming apps for unauthorized content at all. The risks are too high.
</Callout>

## What to Do If You're Concerned

If you think your privacy has been compromised:

1. **Stop the activity immediately** (uninstall risky add-ons)
2. **Clear your cache** (Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache)
3. **Change your Stremio password** (if you think your account was accessed)
4. **Review your ISP account** for unusual activity or notices
5. **Consider consulting a privacy professional** or lawyer (if legal concerns)
