Not all add-ons are created equal. Some may compromise your privacy, security, or device performance. This guide helps you identify and avoid suspicious or malicious add-ons.

## Why Add-on Security Matters

Add-ons have access to:
- Your Stremio account data
- Content you search for and watch
- Network traffic (in some cases)
- Device resources

<Callout type="warning">
Malicious add-ons can steal personal data, inject ads, track your activity, or even compromise your device security.
