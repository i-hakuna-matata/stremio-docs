## General Questions

### What is Stremio?

Stremio is a media center application that organizes and plays video content from various sources via add-ons. It's like a smart TV interface for streaming content. See [What is Stremio?](/start-here/what-is-stremio/) for details.

### Is Stremio free?

Yes, Stremio is completely free. No purchase, subscription, or hidden fees. Some add-ons may require paid services, but the app itself is free.

### Is Stremio legal?

The Stremio app itself is 100% legal worldwide. Whether your **use** of it is legal depends on the add-ons you install and the content you access. See [Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/).

### Is Stremio safe?

The official Stremio app from stremio.com is safe. However, safety depends on:
- Which add-ons you install
- Where you download Stremio from
- How you use it

See [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/) for guidance.

### Do I need a VPN to use Stremio?

No, you don't **need** a VPN. However, some users choose to use one for privacy (especially when using torrent-based add-ons). Remember: **a VPN doesn't make illegal activity legal**. See [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/).

### Does Stremio work without an account?

Yes, you can use Stremio without creating an account. However, an account (free) enables syncing across devices. See [First 10 Minutes Setup](/start-here/first-10-minutes-setup/).

## Add-ons

### What are add-ons?

Add-ons are plugins that connect Stremio to content sources (catalogs, streams, metadata, subtitles). See [Add-ons Explained](/addons/addons-explained/).

### Do I need to install add-ons?

Yes, Stremio has no content by default. You must install add-ons to access movies, shows, or videos.

### Where do I find add-ons?

- Go to **Add-ons** in the Stremio sidebar
- Browse **Community Add-ons**
- Click **Install** on the add-ons you want

See [How to Install & Remove Add-ons Safely](/addons/how-to-install-remove-addons-safely/).

### Which add-ons are safe and legal?

**Safe and legal:**
- YouTube
- Podcasts
- Twitch
- Cinemeta (metadata)
- OpenSubtitles (subtitles)

**Risky/illegal:** Add-ons that promise "free movies and TV" from unauthorized sources. See [How to Evaluate Add-on Trust](/addons/how-to-evaluate-addon-trust/).

### Why can't I find any content?

If Discover and Search are empty, you haven't installed add-ons yet. Install at least one catalog or stream add-on.

### Why do I see "No streams available"?

This means none of your installed add-ons have a source for that title. Try:
- Installing additional add-ons (carefully)
- Searching for a different title
- Checking if the title exists in your add-ons' catalogs

### How do I uninstall an add-on?

1. Go to **Add-ons** → **Installed**
2. Click **Uninstall** next to the add-on
3. Confirm

See [How to Install & Remove Add-ons Safely](/addons/how-to-install-remove-addons-safely/).

### Can I install custom add-ons not in the Community list?

Yes, if you have the add-on's URL. Click **Install from URL** in the Add-ons page. **Be extremely careful**—only install from sources you absolutely trust.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is playback buffering/stuttering?

Common causes:
- Slow or unstable internet
- Server overload (try a different stream)
- Device performance issues
- Cache settings too low

See [Playback & Buffering](/troubleshooting/playback-buffering/) for detailed fixes.

### Why won't videos play at all?

Check:
- Internet connection is working
- Firewall isn't blocking Stremio
- Add-ons are installed and working
- You selected a valid stream

See [Troubleshooting Overview](/troubleshooting/overview/).

### Why are subtitles not appearing?

- Make sure you have a subtitle add-on installed (e.g., OpenSubtitles)
- Check if subtitles are available for that title
- Enable subtitles in the player (CC button or S key)

See [Subtitles Not Working](/troubleshooting/subtitles-not-working/).

### Why is Stremio crashing?

Try:
- Restart Stremio
- Clear cache (Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache)
- Update Stremio to the latest version
- Reinstall if necessary

See [App Crashes & Freezes](/troubleshooting/app-crashes-and-freezes/).

### Why can't I log in?

- Check your email and password are correct
- Try resetting your password (link on login page)
- Check your internet connection
- Clear cache and try again

See [Login & Sync Issues](/troubleshooting/login-sync-issues/).

### How do I clear the cache?

Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache. This deletes temporary files and can fix many issues.

### How do I update Stremio?

Stremio checks for updates automatically. When available, you'll see a notification. Click to update. Or download the latest version from stremio.com and install over your existing version.

## Privacy & Security

### Does Stremio track what I watch?

Stremio itself doesn't track your viewing activity. However:
- Add-ons may log your activity
- Your ISP can see your traffic (unless you use a VPN)

See [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/).

### Is my data private?

Data stored in your Stremio account (library, settings) is private. However, add-ons you install can see and log your requests. Choose add-ons carefully. See [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/).

### Can my ISP see what I'm streaming?

Yes, your ISP can see:
- That you're using Stremio
- IP addresses you connect to
- Amount of data transferred

If privacy is a concern, consider a VPN (doesn't make illegal activity legal, though). See [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/).

### How do I protect myself from malware?

- Only install add-ons from trusted sources
- Don't install add-ons that require disabling security
- Use antivirus software
- Keep Stremio and your OS updated

See [Avoiding Suspicious Add-ons](/privacy-security/avoiding-suspicious-addons/).

### What do I do if I get a copyright notice from my ISP?

1. Stop the activity immediately
2. Uninstall any illegal add-ons
3. Read the notice carefully
4. Consider consulting a lawyer if threatened with legal action

See [AIOStream: Safety Note](/addons/aiostream-safety-note/) for more.

## Performance & Quality

### How do I improve video quality?

- Select a higher quality stream (1080p, 4K) from the Streams tab
- Ensure your internet is fast enough
- Close other apps using bandwidth
- Use wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi if possible

### Why is quality poor even with fast internet?

- The source stream may be low quality (try a different stream)
- Your device may not support high resolutions
- Server issues on the add-on side

### How do I reduce bandwidth usage?

- Choose lower quality streams (480p, 720p)
- Reduce cache size in Settings
- Watch during off-peak hours (less network congestion)

### Can I change the video player?

Stremio uses its built-in player. You can't change it to VLC, etc. (except via advanced workarounds not covered here).

---

## Advanced

### Can I use Stremio with Plex/Jellyfin?

Not directly, but some community add-ons exist. Search for "Plex Stremio add-on" or similar. Configuration varies and isn't covered in this guide.

### Can I create my own add-on?

Yes, if you're a developer. See Stremio's official developer documentation at dev.stremio.com.

### Can I change the UI theme?

Stremio supports light and dark themes (usually follows your system theme). Some customization is possible via custom CSS (advanced).

### Where is Stremio data stored?

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Stremio`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Stremio`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Stremio` or `~/.local/share/Stremio`
- **Android:** App data folder (varies)

### How do I export my library?

Stremio doesn't have a built-in export feature. Your library is stored in the cloud if you have an account. For local backups, you'd need to manually copy data folders (advanced).

---

## Legal & Ethical

### Is streaming the same as downloading?

Legally, in most jurisdictions, yes. Streaming is a form of temporary downloading and is treated as copyright infringement if done without authorization.

### What's the difference between Stremio and Kodi?

- **Stremio** focuses on streaming with a modern UI and built-in syncing
- **Kodi** is more customizable but complex, and better for local media libraries
- Both can be used legally or illegally depending on add-ons/use

### Is using a debrid service legal?

Debrid services themselves are legal. However, using them to access copyrighted content you don't own is illegal. See [Safety & Legality](/start-here/safety-and-legality/).

### What's a torrent, and should I use torrent add-ons?

Torrents are a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. **Using torrents for copyrighted content is illegal** in most places and exposes your IP to others. See [Glossary](/glossary/) and [Privacy Basics](/privacy-security/privacy-basics/).
